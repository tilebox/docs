Many datasets consist of granules that represent a certain geographical area on the earths surface.
Often times a polygon defining the outline of this area - a footprint - is stored alongside other granule metadata in time series datasets.
Tilebox provides special support for working with Geometries out of the box.

Here is an example that loads some `granules` of the `ERS SAR` Opendata dataset, that contains geometries.

```python Loading ERS data
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()

ers_collection = datasets.open_data.asf.ers_sar.collection("ERS-2")
ers_data = ers_collection.load(("2008-02-10T21:00", "2008-02-10T22:00"))
```

## Shapely

In the `ers_data` dataset each granule contains a `geometry` field which represents the footprint each granule as a polygon.
Tilebox automatically converts such geometry fields to `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` objects from the
[shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) library.
By integrating with shapely, you can make use of the rich set of libraries and tooling around it, which includes support for computing
polygon characteristics such as the total area, intersection checks or the conversion to other common formats.

Here are some geometries which are part of the ERS granules loaded.

```python Printing geometries
geometries = ers_data.geometry.values
print(geometries)
```

```

### Accessing Coordinates

You can select one polygon out of the geometries, and access the underlying coordinates, as well as an automatically
computed centroid point.

```python Accessing coordinates and computing a centroid point
polygon = geometries[0]
lon, lat = polygon.exterior.coords.xy
center, = list(polygon.centroid.coords)

print(lon)
print(lat)
print(center)
```

```plaintext Output
array('d', [-150.753244, -152.031574, -149.183655, -147.769339, -150.753244])
array('d', [74.250081, 73.336051, 73.001748, 73.899483, 74.250081])
(-149.92927907414239, 73.62538063474753)
```

<Note>
  Interactive environments such as [Jupyter Notebooks](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks) can also directly visualize
  Polygon shapes graphically, when a `shapely.Polygon` is the output of a cell. Just type `polygon` in an empty cell and
  execute it to get a visual representation of the shape of the polygon.
</Note>

### Visualization on a Map

To visualize polygons on a map, you can use the [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/) library.
Here is a short helper function which produces an OpenStreetMap with the Polygon overlaid on top.

```python visualize helper function
# pip install folium
from folium import Figure, Map, Polygon as FoliumPolygon, GeoJson, TileLayer
from folium.plugins import MiniMap
from shapely import Polygon, to_geojson
from collections.abc import Iterable

def visualize(poly: Polygon | Iterable[Polygon], zoom=4):
    """Visualize a polygon or a list of polygons on a map"""
    if not isinstance(poly, Iterable):
        poly = [poly]

    fig = Figure(width=600, height=600)
    map = Map(location=geometries[len(geometries)//2].centroid.coords[0][::-1], zoom_start=zoom, control_scale=True)
    map.add_child(MiniMap())
    fig.add_child(map)

    for p in poly:
        map.add_child(GeoJson(to_geojson(p)))
    return fig
```

Here is how you can use it.

```python Visualizing our polygon
visualize(polygon)
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/single.png" alt="Single visualization" />

The `visualize` helper function also supports a whole list of polygons, which you can use to showcase the data layout of the ERS granules.

```python Visualizing our polygon
visualize(geometries)
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/granules.png" alt="Granules visualization" />

## Format conversion

Shapely provides support out of the box for converting the Polygons to some common formats,
such as [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) or [Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html)

```python Converting to GeoJSON
from shapely import to_geojson

print(to_geojson(polygon))
```

```plaintext Output
{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-150.753244,74.250081],[-152.031574,73.336051],[-149.183655,73.001748],[-147.769339,73.899483],[-150.753244,74.250081]]]}
```

```python Converting to WKT
from shapely import to_wkt

print(to_wkt(polygon))
```

```plaintext Output
POLYGON ((-150.753244 74.250081, -152.031574 73.336051, -149.183655 73.001748, -147.769339 73.899483, -150.753244 74.250081))
```

## Checking intersections

One common task when working with geometries is to check whether a given geometry falls into a certain area of interest.
Fortunately, `shapely` provides an intersects method for this use case.

```python Checking intersections
from shapely import box

# box representing the rectangular area lon=(-160, -150) and lat=(69, 70)
area_of_interest = box(-160, 69, -150, 70)

for i, polygon in enumerate(geometries):
    if area_of_interest.intersects(polygon):
        print(f"{ers_data.granule_name[i].item()} intersects the area of interest!")
    else:
        print(f"{ers_data.granule_name[i].item()} doesn't intersect the area of interest!")
```

```plaintext Output
E2_66974_STD_F264 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F265 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F267 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F269 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F271 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F273 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F275 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F277 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F279 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F281 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F283 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F285 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F289 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
```

## Combining polygons

As you saw in the preceding visualization of the granule footprints, the granules all put together form a whole orbit from pole to pole.
Often times measurements are then combined together in certain processing steps.
you can also do the same thing for the geometries, and combine them into a single polygon, which represents the hull around all individual footprints.
To do so, you can make use of [shapely.unary_union](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.unary_union.html)

```python Combining multiple polygons
from shapely.ops import unary_union

hull = unary_union(geometries)
visualize(hull)
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/unary_union.png" alt="Unary union visualization" />

## Multi Polygons

As you can see, the computed hull actually consists of two polygons, because there is a gap (probably a missing granule) in the geometries.

Shapely represents such geometries as a [shapely.MultiPolygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/shapely.MultiPolygon.html),
which in essence just represent a series of individual polygons put together.

```python Accessing individual polygons of a MultiPolygon
print(f"The computed hull of type {type(hull).__name__} consists of {len(hull.geoms)} sub polygons")
for i, poly in enumerate(hull.geoms):
    print(f"Sub polygon {i} has an area of {poly.area}")
```

```plaintext Output
The computed hull of type MultiPolygon consists of 2 sub polygons
Sub polygon 0 has an area of 2.025230449898011
Sub polygon 1 has an area of 24.389998081651527
```

## Antimeridian Crossings

One common problem when working with `longitude / latitude` geometries like this are crossings of the 180-meridian, or the antimeridian.
Consider the coordinates of a `LineString` from Japan to the United States. It's longitude coordinates would look something like the following.

`140, 141, 142, ..., 179, 180, -179, -178, ..., -125, -124`

Libraries like `shapely` are not designed for handling spherical coordinate systems, extra care needs to be taken when handling such geometries.

The `GeoJSON` spec actually provides a solution for this problem.
In the section [Antimeridian Cutting](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.9) they propose to
always cut lines and polygons into two parts, one representing the eastern hemisphere, and the other one the western hemisphere.

As an example, here is an `ERS` granule where this exact problem occurs.

```python Antimeridian Crossing
# a granule that crosses the antimeridian
granule = ers_collection.find("0119bb86-0260-5819-6aab-f99796417155")
polygon = granule.geometry.item()
print(polygon.exterior.coords.xy)
visualize(polygon)
```

```plaintext Output
array('d', [177.993407, 176.605009, 179.563047, -178.904076, 177.993407])
array('d', [74.983185, 74.074615, 73.727752, 74.61847, 74.983185])
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/antimeridian_buggy.png" alt="Antimeridian buggy visualization" />

This 2D visualization doesn't seem right. Not only the visualization is wrong, the same also applies for
calculations which you may want to do. For example, testing whether the granule intersects the 0-meridian gives the wrong result.

```python Problems with calculating intersections
from shapely import LineString

null_meridian = LineString([(0, -90), (0, 90)])
print(polygon.intersects(null_meridian))  # True - but this is wrong!
```

One solution to solve this issue is to cut the polygon into two parts.
The [antimeridian](https://pypi.org/project/antimeridian/) package does exactly that.

```python Cutting the polygon along the antimeridian
# pip install antimeridian

import antimeridian
fixed_polygon = antimeridian.fix_polygon(polygon)
visualize(fixed_polygon)

print(fixed_polygon.intersects(null_meridian))  # False - this is correct now
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/antimeridian_fixed.png" alt="Antimeridian fixed visualization" />

Since `shapely` is not aware of the spherical nature of the data, the `centroid` of this fixed polygon is still wrong.
The `antimeridian` package also has a function to correct this.

```python Calculating the centroid of a fixed polygon crossing the antimeridian
print("Wrongly computed centroid coordinates (shapely)")
print(list(fixed_polygon.centroid.coords))
print("Correct centroid coordinates (antimeridian taken into account)")
print(list(antimeridian.centroid(fixed_polygon).coords))
```

```plaintext Output
Wrongly computed centroid coordinates (shapely)
[(139.8766350146937, 74.3747116658462)]
Correct centroid coordinates (antimeridian taken into account)
[(178.7782777050171, 74.3747116658462)]
```

## Spherical Geometry

Another approach to handling the antimeridian issue is to perform all coordinate related calculations,
such as polygon intersections, in a [3D spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system).

One great library to do this is [spherical_geometry](https://spherical-geometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Here is an example.

```python Spherical Geometry
# pip install spherical-geometry

from spherical_geometry.polygon import SphericalPolygon
from spherical_geometry.vector import lonlat_to_vector

lon, lat = polygon.exterior.coords.xy
spherical_poly = SphericalPolygon.from_lonlat(lon, lat)
# let's check the x, y, z coordinates of the spherical polygon:
print(list(spherical_poly.points))
```

```plaintext Output
[array([[-0.25894363,  0.00907234,  0.96584983],
       [-0.2651968 , -0.00507317,  0.96418096],
       [-0.28019363,  0.00213687,  0.95994112],
       [-0.27390375,  0.01624885,  0.96161984],
       [-0.25894363,  0.00907234,  0.96584983]])]
```

Now you can easily compute intersections or check whether a certain point is inside the polygon.
You can compare the incorrect computation from `shapely` with the fixed version when using `spherical_geometry`.

```python Correct calculations using spherical geometry
# a point on the null-meridian, way off from our polygon
null_meridian_point = 0, 74.4
# a point actually inside our polygon
point_inside = 178.8, 74.4

print("Shapely results:")
print("- Null meridian point inside:", polygon.contains(Point(*null_meridian_point)))
print("- Actual inside point inside:", polygon.contains(Point(*point_inside)))

print("Spherical geometry results:")
print("- Null meridian point inside:", spherical_poly.contains_lonlat(*null_meridian_point))
print("- Actual inside point inside:", spherical_poly.contains_lonlat(*point_inside))
```

```plaintext Output
Shapely results:
- Null meridian point inside: True
- Actual inside point inside: False
Spherical geometry results:
- Null meridian point inside: False
- Actual inside point inside: True
```
