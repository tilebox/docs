Many datasets consist of granules that represent specific geographical areas on the Earth's surface. Often, a polygon defining the outline of these areas—a footprint—accompanies other granule metadata in time series datasets. Tilebox provides built-in support for working with geometries.

Here's an example that loads some granules from the `ERS SAR` Opendata dataset, which contains geometries.

```python Loading ERS data
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()

ers_collection = datasets.open_data.asf.ers_sar.collection("ERS-2")
ers_data = ers_collection.load(("2008-02-10T21:00", "2008-02-10T22:00"))
```

## Shapely

In the `ers_data` dataset, each granule includes a `geometry` field that represents the footprint of each granule as a polygon. Tilebox automatically converts geometry fields to `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` objects from the [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) library. By integrating with Shapely, you can use the rich set of libraries and tools it provides. That includes support for computing polygon characteristics such as total area, intersection checks, and conversion to other formats.

```python Printing geometries
geometries = ers_data.geometry.values
print(geometries)
```

Each geometry is a [shapely.Geometry](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/geometry.html#geometry).

<Tip>
    Geometries are not always [Polygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon) objects. More complex footprint geometries are represented as [MultiPolygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.MultiPolygon.html#shapely.MultiPolygon) objects.
</Tip>

### Accessing Coordinates

You can select a polygon from the geometries and access the underlying coordinates and an automatically computed centroid point.

```python Accessing coordinates and computing a centroid point
polygon = geometries[0]
lon, lat = polygon.exterior.coords.xy
center, = list(polygon.centroid.coords)

print(lon)
print(lat)
print(center)
```

```plaintext Output
array('d', [-150.753244, -152.031574, -149.183655, -147.769339, -150.753244])
array('d', [74.250081, 73.336051, 73.001748, 73.899483, 74.250081])
(-149.92927907414239, 73.62538063474753)
```

<Note>
  Interactive environments such as [Jupyter Notebooks](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks) can visualize Polygon shapes graphically. Just type `polygon` in an empty cell and execute it for a visual representation of the polygon shape.
</Note>

### Visualization on a Map

To visualize polygons on a map, you can use [Folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/). Below is a helper function that produces an OpenStreetMap with the Polygon overlaid.

```python visualize helper function
# pip install folium
from folium import Figure, Map, Polygon as FoliumPolygon, GeoJson, TileLayer
from folium.plugins import MiniMap
from shapely import Polygon, to_geojson
from collections.abc import Iterable

def visualize(poly: Polygon | Iterable[Polygon], zoom=4):
    """Visualize a polygon or a list of polygons on a map"""
    if not isinstance(poly, Iterable):
        poly = [poly]

    fig = Figure(width=600, height=600)
    map = Map(location=geometries[len(geometries)//2].centroid.coords[0][::-1], zoom_start=zoom, control_scale=True)
    map.add_child(MiniMap())
    fig.add_child(map)

    for p in poly:
        map.add_child(GeoJson(to_geojson(p)))
    return fig
```

Here's how to use it.

```python Visualizing a polygon
visualize(polygon)
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/single.png" alt="Single visualization" />

The `visualize` helper function supports a list of polygons, which can display the data layout of the ERS granules.

```python Visualizing multiple polygons
visualize(geometries)
```

## Format conversion

Shapely supports converting Polygons to some common formats, such as [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) or [Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html).

```python Converting to GeoJSON
from shapely import to_geojson

print(to_geojson(polygon))
```

```plaintext Output
{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-150.753244,74.250081],[-152.031574,73.336051],[-149.183655,73.001748],[-147.769339,73.899483],[-150.753244,74.250081]]]}
```

```python Converting to WKT
from shapely import to_wkt

print(to_wkt(polygon))
```

```plaintext Output
POLYGON ((-150.753244 74.250081, -152.031574 73.336051, -149.183655 73.001748, -147.769339 73.899483, -150.753244 74.250081))
```

## Checking intersections

One common task when working with geometries is checking if a given geometry falls into a specific area of interest. Shapely provides an `intersects` method for this purpose.

```python Checking intersections
from shapely import box

# Box representing the rectangular area lon=(-160, -150) and lat=(69, 70)
area_of_interest = box(-160, 69, -150, 70)

for i, polygon in enumerate(geometries):
    if area_of_interest.intersects(polygon):
        print(f"{ers_data.granule_name[i].item()} intersects the area of interest!")
    else:
        print(f"{ers_data.granule_name[i].item()} doesn't intersect the area of interest!")
```

```plaintext Output
E2_66974_STD_F264 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F265 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F267 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F269 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F271 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F273 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F275 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F277 intersects the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F279 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F281 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F283 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F285 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
E2_66974_STD_F289 doesn't intersect the area of interest!
```

## Combining polygons

As shown in the visualization of the granule footprints, the granules collectively form an orbit from pole to pole. Measurements are often combined during processing. You can do the same with geometries by combining them into a single polygon, which represents the hull around all individual footprints using [shapely.unary_union](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.unary_union.html).

```python Combining multiple polygons
from shapely.ops import unary_union

hull = unary_union(geometries)
visualize(hull)
```

The computed hull consists of two polygons due to a gap (probably a missing granule) in the geometries. Such geometries are represented as [Multi Polygons](#multi-polygons).

<img src="/assets/geometries/unary_union.png" alt="Unary union visualization" />

## Multi Polygons

A collection of one or more non-overlapping polygons combined into a single geometry is called a [MultiPolygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/shapely.MultiPolygon.html). Footprint geometries can be of type `MultiPolygon` due to gaps or pole discontinuities. The computed hull in the previous example is a `MultiPolygon`.

```python Accessing individual polygons of a MultiPolygon
print(f"The computed hull of type {type(hull).__name__} consists of {len(hull.geoms)} sub polygons")
for i, poly in enumerate(hull.geoms):
    print(f"Sub polygon {i} has an area of {poly.area}")
```

```plaintext Output
The computed hull of type MultiPolygon consists of 2 sub polygons
Sub polygon 0 has an area of 2.025230449898011
Sub polygon 1 has an area of 24.389998081651527
```

## Antimeridian Crossings

A common issue with `longitude / latitude` geometries is crossings of the 180-degree meridian, or the antimeridian. For example, the coordinates of a `LineString` from Japan to the United States might look like this:

`140, 141, 142, ..., 179, 180, -179, -178, ..., -125, -124`

Libraries like Shapely are not designed to handle spherical coordinate systems, so caution is necessary with such geometries.

Here's an `ERS` granule demonstrating this issue.

```python Antimeridian Crossing
# A granule that crosses the antimeridian
granule = ers_collection.find("0119bb86-0260-5819-6aab-f99796417155")
polygon = granule.geometry.item()
print(polygon.exterior.coords.xy)
visualize(polygon)
```

```plaintext Output
array('d', [177.993407, 176.605009, 179.563047, -178.904076, 177.993407])
array('d', [74.983185, 74.074615, 73.727752, 74.61847, 74.983185])
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/antimeridian_buggy.png" alt="Antimeridian buggy visualization" />

This 2D visualization appears incorrect. Both the visualization and any calculations performed may yield inaccurate results. For instance, testing whether the granule intersects the 0-degree meridian provides a false positive.

```python Problems with calculating intersections
from shapely import LineString

null_meridian = LineString([(0, -90), (0, 90)])
print(polygon.intersects(null_meridian))  # True - but this is incorrect!
```

The GeoJSON specification offers a solution for this problem. In the section [Antimeridian Cutting](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.9), it suggests always cutting lines and polygons into two parts—one for the eastern hemisphere and one for the western hemisphere.
In python, this can be achieved using the [antimeridian](https://pypi.org/project/antimeridian/) package.

```python Cutting the polygon along the antimeridian
# pip install antimeridian

import antimeridian
fixed_polygon = antimeridian.fix_polygon(polygon)
visualize(fixed_polygon)

print(fixed_polygon.intersects(null_meridian))  # False - this is correct now
```

<img src="/assets/geometries/antimeridian_fixed.png" alt="Antimeridian fixed visualization" />

Since Shapely is unaware of the spherical nature of this data, the **centroid** of the fixed polygon **is still incorrect**. The antimeridian package also includes a function to correct this.

```python Calculating the centroid of a cut polygon crossing the antimeridian
print("Wrongly computed centroid coordinates (Shapely)")
print(list(fixed_polygon.centroid.coords))
print("Correct centroid coordinates (Antimeridian taken into account)")
print(list(antimeridian.centroid(fixed_polygon).coords))
```

```plaintext Output
Wrongly computed centroid coordinates (shapely)
[(139.8766350146937, 74.3747116658462)]
Correct centroid coordinates (antimeridian taken into account)
[(178.7782777050171, 74.3747116658462)]
```

## Spherical Geometry

Another approach to handle the antimeridian issue is performing all coordinate-related calculations, such as polygon intersections, in a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system).

One useful library for this is [spherical_geometry](https://spherical-geometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Here's an example.

```python Spherical Geometry
# pip install spherical-geometry

from spherical_geometry.polygon import SphericalPolygon
from spherical_geometry.vector import lonlat_to_vector

lon, lat = polygon.exterior.coords.xy
spherical_poly = SphericalPolygon.from_lonlat(lon, lat)
# Let's check the x, y, z coordinates of the spherical polygon:
print(list(spherical_poly.points))
```

```plaintext Output
[array([[-0.25894363,  0.00907234,  0.96584983],
       [-0.2651968 , -0.00507317,  0.96418096],
       [-0.28019363,  0.00213687,  0.95994112],
       [-0.27390375,  0.01624885,  0.96161984],
       [-0.25894363,  0.00907234,  0.96584983]])]
```

Now, you can compute intersections or check if a particular point is within the polygon. You can compare the incorrect calculation using `shapely` with the correct version when using `spherical_geometry`.

```python Correct calculations using spherical geometry
# A point on the null-meridian, way off from our polygon
null_meridian_point = 0, 74.4
# A point actually inside our polygon
point_inside = 178.8, 74.4

print("Shapely results:")
print("- Null meridian point inside:", polygon.contains(Point(*null_meridian_point)))
print("- Actual inside point inside:", polygon.contains(Point(*point_inside)))

print("Spherical geometry results:")
print("- Null meridian point inside:", spherical_poly.contains_lonlat(*null_meridian_point))
print("- Actual inside point inside:", spherical_poly.contains_lonlat(*point_inside))
```

```plaintext Output
Shapely results:
- Null meridian point inside: True
- Actual inside point inside: False
Spherical geometry results:
- Null meridian point inside: False
- Actual inside point inside: True
```
