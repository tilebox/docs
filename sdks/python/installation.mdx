# Installation

This section describes the options that are available for installing the Tilebox python clients.

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Tilebox API, you need an API key. Please go to
  [console.tilebox.com](https://console.tilebox.com/settings/api-keys) to create an API key.
</Note>

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.10 or higher

## Private Python Package Index

To conveniently and still privately allow the installation of the Tilebox Python clients as well as of user-generated packages, we offer a private PyPI server.

The server is located at **[https://pypi.tilebox.com/](https://pypi.tilebox.com/)** and is accessible with the personal API key of the user.
You can find out more about this private PyPI instance [on our documentation page about this service](/python/installation#private-python-package-index).

For installing the Tilebox client packages, there are multiples options available, depending on your preferred package manager.
Below are examples for a few popular package managers, namely `pip`, `poetry` and `pipenv`.

## Package overview

The Tilebox Python clients are split into several packages that work together. The main package for the data access module
is called `tilebox-datasets`. The main package for the workflow orchestrator is called `tilebox-workflows`.

Additionally, there are other, dataset specific packages, which are (optional) dependencies of `tilebox-datasets` and
are required for specific functionality when accessing certain datasets. This modular approach allows to keep any dataset
specific logic out of the main package, and instead provide it as a separate package which only authorized users
have access to.

To get the full capability of the Tilebox Python clients,the recommended way is to install all the packages
listed below.

<PythonPackageOverview />

## Pip

To install your Tilebox packages using pip from our private PyPI, run the following command, which uses basic authentication
with the API key as password:

<PipInstall />

<Note>
  The flag `-U` stands for `--upgrade`, and ensures that the latest version of the package is installed in case you
  already have an older version installed.
</Note>

## Poetry

To install private packages using Poetry, first add the repository as a supplemental source to your `pyproject.toml`.

<CodeGroup>

```txt Poetry CLI
poetry source add --priority=supplemental tilebox https://pypi.tilebox.com/
```

```txt Inside pyproject.toml
[[tool.poetry.source]] name = "tilebox" url = "https://pypi.tilebox.com"
priority = "explicit"
```

</CodeGroup>

Then add your Tilebox API key as authentication token to poetry. You can either add it to the poetry keyring
(recommended) or add an environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Poetry Keyring
poetry config http-basic.tilebox __token__ YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY
```

```sh Environment Variable
export POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_TILEBOX=YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  This ensures the token is not visible in the `pyproject.toml` file, so you can safely commit it to your repository.
  The token is applicable to all poetry projects that define a source with the name `tilebox`.
</Note>

Then you can install the packages like any other package using an explicit source parameter.

<PoetryInstall />

Poetry comes with great documentation on the topic, located
at [https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#using-a-private-repository](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#using-a-private-repository).

<Note>Make sure to keep your Tilebox client packages up to date by running `poetry update` regularly.</Note>

## Pipenv

To install private packages using Pipenv, add the new index to the `Pipfile`, like so, making sure to pass the token as
an environment variable: `export TILEBOX_API_KEY=YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY`

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[[source]]
url = "https://-:${TILEBOX_API_KEY}@pypi.tilebox.com"
verify_ssl = true
name = "tilebox"
```

Pipenv allows to select which index to use for which package by adding e.g. `index="tilebox"` to the properties dictionary
of a package.

Example:

<PipenvInstall />

Pipenv documentation on private repositories is located
at [https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html).

<Note>Make sure to keep your Tilebox client packages up to date by running `pipenv update` regularly.</Note>

## Browsing packages

You can browse packages or package versions by
visiting [https://pypi.tilebox.com/](https://pypi.tilebox.com/) in any browser, and passing your access
API key as a password.

<Note>
  The username is not relevant in the authentication process. If your browser asks for a username, you can enter any
  string, e.g. `-`.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Installation and Lock issues

Tools like `poetry` and `pipenv` create lock files to ensure that the same versions of packages are installed across
different environments. Sometimes, locking issues can occur, which often show up as cryptic error messages.
Below is an example of a couple of such messages:

```
[pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved. You likely have a mismatch in your sub-dependencies.
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to lock Pipfile.lock!")
RuntimeError: Failed to lock Pipfile.lock!

[pipenv.exceptions.InstallError]: ERROR: No matching distribution found for tilebox-datasets
ERROR: Couldn't install package: [Requirement(...)]

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tilebox-datasets (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tilebox-datasets

CRITICAL:pipenv.patched.pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib.factory:Ignored the following versions that require a different python
version: 1.11.0 Requires-Python `<3.13,>=3.9`; 1.11.0rc1 Requires-Python `<3.13,>=3.9`
```

In case you encounter such issues, follow these steps to resolve them:

1. Double check the python version you are using. The Tilebox Python clients require Python 3.10 or higher.
   You can run `python --version` to check your python version.
2. Make sure you have the right Tilebox API key configured for the tool you are using. The API key is required to access
   the private PyPI server. You can find your API keys at [console.tilebox.com](https://console.tilebox.com/settings/api-keys).
3. In case a specific package could not be resolved, you can try navigating to [pypi.tilebox.com](https://pypi.tilebox.com/)
   in your browser and check if it shows up there. If prompted, specify an empty username and your API key as a password.
4. If none of the preceding help, sometimes removing an existing virtual environment and re-create it can help resolving issues.
   Depending on the tool you are using, this is done differently. Check out the guides for managing virtual environments for
   [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#deleting-the-environments). For `pipenv`, you can
   run `pipenv --rm` to remove the virtual environment and then `pipenv install` to re-create it.
5. If you are still encountering issues, please [reach out to us at](mailto:support@tilebox.com).

### Outdated packages

In case your locally installed packages are not up to date, you may encounter warnings like the following:

<WarningNote>
  Skipped **Opendata** dataset group. You are probably missing the package `tilebox-client-opendata`.
</WarningNote>

<WarningNote>
  Skipped **Opendata** dataset **sentinel3_olci**. Your `tilebox-datasets-opendata` package is probably outdated.
</WarningNote>

These warning indicates that new datasets have been added to Tilebox for which you are missing the corresponding
client package or the version of the installed client package is outdated.
To fix this, simply run the installation commands described earlier again to update existing and install
missing packages.
