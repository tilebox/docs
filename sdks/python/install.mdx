## Package Overview

Tilebox offers a Python SDK for accessing Tilebox services. The SDK includes separate packages that can be installed individually based on the services you wish to use, or all together for a comprehensive experience.

## Installation

Install the Tilebox python packages using your preferred package manager.

<Tip>
  For new projects Tilebox recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```bash uv
uv add tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows tilebox-storage
```
```bash pip
pip install tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows tilebox-storage
```
```bash poetry
poetry add tilebox-datasets="*" tilebox-workflows="*" tilebox-storage="*"
```
```bash pipenv
pipenv install tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows tilebox-storage
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting up a local JupyterLab environment

<Tip>
  To get started quickly, you can also use an existing Jupyter-compatible cloud environment such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
</Tip>

If you want to set up a local Jupyter environment to explore the SDK or to run the [Sample notebooks](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks) locally, install [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) for a browser-based development environment. It's advised to install the Tilebox packages along with JupyterLab, [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html), and [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) for an enhanced experience.

```uv uv
mkdir tilebox-exploration
cd tilebox-exploration

uv init --no-package
uv add tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows tilebox-storage
uv add jupyterlab ipywidgets tqdm
uv run jupyter lab
```

### Trying it out

After installation, create a new notebook and paste the following code snippet to verify your installation. If you're new to Jupyter, you can refer to the guide on [interactive environments](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks#interactive-environments).

```python Python
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()

collection = datasets.open_data.copernicus.landsat8_oli_tirs.collection("L1T")
data = collection.load(("2015-01-01", "2020-01-01"), show_progress=True)
data
```

If the installation is successful, the output should appear as follows.
