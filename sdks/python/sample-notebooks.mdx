To get the hang of the Python client quickly and effortlessly this is a list of use-cases and sample notebooks.

Each notebook can be executed from top to bottom, and does not require any setup.

## Quick Link

Check out some example notebooks prepared in this shared [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I7G35LLeB2SmKQJFsyhpSVNyZK9uOeJt).

<Note>
  Within Drive you can right click a notebook and select "Open with -> Google Colaboratory" to open it in an interactive
  Google Colab environment.

## Notebook Overview

The Tilebox ERS Opendata Demo is a good starting point to get familiar with the Python client, and recommended for everyone who wants to use the client.

- [Tilebox ERS Opendata Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LTYhLKy8m9psMhu0DvANs7hyS3ViVpas)

This notebook shows how to use the Python client to query metadata from the ERS-SAR Opendata dataset.
Then it shows how to filter the results based on geographical location, and then download the product data for a specific granule.

- [Tilebox S5P Tropomi Methane Data Access](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eVYARNFnTIeQqBs6gqeay01EDvRk2EI4)

This notebook shows how to use the Python client to query the S5P Tropomi Opendata dataset for Methane products.
Then it shows how to download and access the corresponding product file, and finally how to plot methane data in a georeferenced map plot.

Cells are executed one-by-one by typing `Shift+Enter`, most commonly used libraries are pre-installed.

<Note>All the demo notebooks require python 3.10 or upwards.</Note>

## Interactive Environments

Jupyter, Google Colab or JetBrains Datalore are interactive environments that make developing and sharing algorithmic code simple and accessible.
They allow to work in notebooks, which are documents that contains both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations, and more.
Notebooks don't need any setup and can be shared with others.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Jupyter">
    [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are the original interactive environment for Python. They are great to
    work with, but require a local installation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Google Colab">
    [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free tool that offers a hosted interactive Python
    environment. Google Colab is great to connect to local Jupyter instances, and to share code using Google
    credentials, or within organizations that use Google Workspace.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="JetBrains Datalore">
    [JetBrains Datalore](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/) is a free and convenient way to collaboratively test, develop
    and share Python code and algorithms. It comes with secret management built in, so you can store your credentials
    and share notebooks. Datalore comes with the advanced JetBrains syntax highlighting and autocompletion software
    developers are used to. Note that it currently supports only Python 3.8, which is not compatible with the Tilebox
    Python client.

Seeing that Colab is a hosted, free tool that supports all requirements including Python â‰¥3.10, it's recommended to use Colab.

## Installing Packages

From within your interactive environment you can install missing packages via pip in "magic" cells started with
an exclamation mark.

```bash
# pip is already installed in your interactive environment
!pip3 install ....
```

All APIs or commands that require authentication can be used through client libraries that hide the tokens, such that
notebooks can be shared without sharing personal credentials.

## Executing Code

Code can be executed by pressing the play button in the top left corner of the cell, or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
While the code is running the cell show a spinning icon, and when the code is done the icon is replaced by
a number. This number indicates the order in which the cells were executed. The output of the cell is shown below
the code.

## Authorization

When sharing notebooks it's important to not share your Tilebox API key by using it directly.
Instead, there are two methods to use the Tilebox Python client in interactive environments.
Using environment variables, or interactively.

```python Using environment variables to store your API key
# first define an environment variable "TILEBOX_API_KEY" which contains your API key
import os
token = os.getenv("TILEBOX_API_KEY")
```

**Interactive** authorization is possible by using the builtin `getpass` module. It prompts the user for the API key
when running the code, which is stored in memory and again is not shared with other users when a notebook is shared.

```python Interactively providing your API key
from getpass import getpass
token = getpass("API key:")
```
