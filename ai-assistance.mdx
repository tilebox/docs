## Providing Tilebox specific context

AI Assistants and Large Language Models (LLMs) can help you answer questions and provide guidance on how to use Tilebox, give you hints about relevant sections in the docs related to your questions and even help you creating your first workflows.

<Card title="Download Documentation for LLMs" icon="brain-circuit" href="https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt" horizontal>
Download the complete Tilebox Documentation as a plain text file to provide it to your AI assistant or large language model.
</Card>

The full content of the Tilebox Documentation is available in plain markdown format at [https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt). Upload this document to an AI Assistant or a large language models to provide Tilebox specific context.

<Tip>
The [Documentation Context](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt) is always updated when the documentation changes. In case you download it, refresh it from time to time to also always stay up to date.
</Tip>

## Example prompt

After you have uploaded the [Documentation Context](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt) to your AI assistant or large language model, you can now prompt it with questions and get tailored and up-to-date responses.

Below prompt is an example of how your AI assistant can help you get started with Tilebox.

```txt Example prompt
Generate a script that

- Creates a cluster
- Configures console logging
- Contains a Fibonacci calculator workflow that is using a local filesystem cache.
  Make sure you get task dependencies right.
  Make sure to only print the final result as the last step of the workflow.
  Write logs to let us know what is happening.
- Submits a job for the number 7
- Starts a processing runner

Do not invent APIs. All available Tilebox APIs are documented.
```

## Claude

[Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) is a great choice for an AI assistant to get started with Tilebox. To provide it with Tilebox specific context, create a [new project](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9517075-what-are-projects), and then upload the [llms-full.txt](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt) as project knowledge.
You can then prompt it with questions or use it to generate scripts. Check out the [example prompt](#example-prompt) to get started.

## ChatGPT

Experiments with [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/?model=gpt-4o) have lead to mixed results so far. It worked well for answering questions, but it struggled to generate workflow scripts, often imagining APIs or using them in subtly wrong ways. You may want to consider using [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](#claude) instead.
