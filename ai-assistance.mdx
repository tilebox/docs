## Tilebox MCP Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and
external services. Tilebox provides such an MCP server that exposes tools for listing, querying and retrieving the schema
of datasets, as well as tools for interacting with workflows.

### How the Tilebox MCP server can help

When an AI tool like Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT has the Tilebox MCP server configured, it can proactively invoke relevant
tools. For example, when asking a question about a specific dataset, the AI tool can query the Tilebox MCP server for the
dataset schema and include the correct, and up-to-date information about it in the response.

The Tilebox MCP server at `https://mcp.tilebox.com/mcp` provides tools for:
- Accessing and interacting with Tilebox datasets and workflows
- Searching the Tilebox documentation

It requires authentication using a Tilebox API key. When configured, AI agents can query datasets, interact with workflows, and search the documentation for detailed context on specific topics.

### Configuring the Tilebox MCP server

To configure your AI tools to use the Tilebox MCP server, you need to point it to the correct URL using the `http` transport.
Additionally you'll need to provide an `Authorization` header with your Tilebox API key as the bearer token.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tilebox": {
      "url": "https://mcp.tilebox.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop

Run the following command to add the Tilebox MCP server to Claude:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http "Tilebox" https://mcp.tilebox.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY>"
```

## Providing the full Tilebox documentation as context

As an alternative to using the MCP server's documentation search, you can also provide the full Tilebox documentation as context to your AI assistant or language model.
To do so, you can download the complete documentation as a plain text file below.

The full content of the Tilebox documentation is available in plain markdown format at [https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt). Upload this document to your AI assistant or LLM to provide it with Tilebox-specific context.

<Tip>
The [Documentation Context](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt) is updated whenever the documentation changes. If you download the file, refresh it occasionally to stay up-to-date.
