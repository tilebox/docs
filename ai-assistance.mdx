## Providing complete Tilebox context

AI assistants and Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer questions, guide you in using Tilebox, suggest relevant sections in the documentation, and assist you in creating workflows.

<Card title="Download documentation for LLMs" icon="brain-circuit" href="https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt" horizontal>
Download the complete Tilebox documentation as a plain text file to share with your AI assistant or language model.
</Card>

The full content of the Tilebox documentation is available in plain markdown format at [https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt). Upload this document to your AI assistant or LLM to provide it with Tilebox-specific context.

<Tip>
The [Documentation Context](https://docs.tilebox.com/llms-full.txt) is updated whenever the documentation changes. If you download the file, refresh it occasionally to stay up-to-date.

## Providing tailored context via MCP

Tilebox Docs can be installed as an MCP tool, so an MCP client can ask for detailed context on specific topics.

Run the following command to generate an MCP server for Tilebox Docs.

```bash
npx mint-mcp add tilebox
```

The command line tool will guide you along the installation process for Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Augment Code or other MCP clients.

<Tip>
The MCP server always retrieves the most up to date version of the documentation.
