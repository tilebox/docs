## Tilebox MCP Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and
external services. Tilebox provides such an MCP server that exposes tools for listing, querying and retrieving the schema
of datasets, as well as tools for interacting with workflows.

### How the Tilebox MCP servers can help

When an AI tool like Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT has the Tilebox MCP server configured, it can proactively invoke relevant
tools. For example, when asking a question about a specific dataset, the AI tool can query the Tilebox MCP server for the
dataset schema and include the correct, and up-to-date information about it in the response.

Tilebox provides two MCP servers:

- `https://mcp.tilebox.com/` - This MCP server provides tools for accessing and interacting with Tilebox datasets and workflows. It requires authentication using a Tilebox API key.
- `https://docs.tilebox.com/mcp` - This MCP server provides access to the Tilebox documentation. It does not require authentication. When configured, AI agents can ask for detailed context on specific topics.

### Configuring the Tilebox MCP servers

To configure your AI tools to use the Tilebox MCP servers, you need to point it to the correct URLs using the `http` transport.
Additionally you'll need to provide an `Authorization` header with your Tilebox API key as the bearer token for the `https://mcp.tilebox.com/` server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tilebox": {
      "url": "https://mcp.tilebox.com/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY>"
      }
    },
    "tilebox-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.tilebox.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop

Run the following commands to add the Tilebox MCP server to Claude:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http "Tilebox" https://mcp.tilebox.com/ --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY>"
claude mcp add --transport http "Tilebox Docs" https://docs.tilebox.com/mcp
```

## Providing the full Tilebox documentation as context
