description: You'll need to authenticate your requests to access the Tilebox API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Tilebox offers to authenticate your API requests with API keys passed as bearer tokens.

## Creating an API key

If you don't have an API key yet, you can create one by logging into the [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com), heading to [Settings -> API Keys](https://console.tilebox.com/settings/api-keys) and clicking on the "Create API Key" button.

<Info>
Always keep your API Keys safe and deactivate them if you suspect that they may have been compromised.

## Bearer token authentication

Bearer tokens are the main form of authentication for the Tilebox API. You need to pass your API key as the token parameter when creating an instance of your client.

```python
from tilebox.datasets import Client as DatasetsClient
from tilebox.workflows import Client as WorkflowsClient

datasets_client = DatasetsClient(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
workflows_client = WorkflowsClient(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
```

<Tip>
If you configure your API key as an environment variable called `TILEBOX_API_KEY`, you can omit the token parameter when creating a client.
