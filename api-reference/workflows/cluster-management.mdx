You can use an instance of the `ClusterClient` to find, list, create, and delete clusters.

<RequestExample>

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
cluster_client = client.clusters()  

# Find, List, Create and Delete clusters
cluster = cluster_client.find("my-cluster-EdsdUozYprBJDL")  # cluster-slug
all_clusters = cluster_client.all()
# will generate a new cluster slug from the provided name
cluster = cluster_client.create("My Cluster")
cluster_client.delete("my-cluster-EdsdUozYprBJDL")
```
