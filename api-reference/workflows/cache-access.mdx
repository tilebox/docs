You can use the `job_cache` attribute of the `ExecutionContext` object to access a shared cache for the job. The cache
is a key value store, where the keys are strings and the values are bytes. This allows you to pass data between tasks.
Make sure to specify dependencies between tasks to ensure that certain cache keys are only accessed after they have
been written to.

```python Python (Sync)
class WriterTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        context.job_cache["some-key"] = b"my-value"

class ReaderTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        data = context.job_cache["some-key"]
```

```python Python (Async)
class WriterTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        context.job_cache["some-key"] = b"my-value"

class ReaderTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        data = context.job_cache["some-key"]
```
