If a job fails, you can retry it by calling the `retry` method of the `JobClient` instance.

<RequestExample>

```python Python (Sync)
job = job_client.submit(...)  # see above
# job is now executing on some task runners, but fails
# so let's retry it
job_client.retry(job)
```

```python Python (Async)
job = await job_client.submit(...)  # see above
# job is now executing on some task runners, but fails
# so let's retry it
await job_client.retry(job)
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="job" type="Job">
  The job to retry.
</ParamField>
