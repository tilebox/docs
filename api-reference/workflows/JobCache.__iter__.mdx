```python
def JobCache.__iter__() -> Iterator[str]
```

List all available keys in a job cache group. Only keys that are direct children of the current group are returned.
For nested groups, first access the group and then iterate over its keys.

## Parameters

<RequestExample>

```python Python
# within a Tasks execute method, access the job cache
# def execute(context: ExecutionContext)
cache = context.job_cache

# iterate over all keys
for key in cache:
  print(cache[key])

# or collect as list
keys = list(cache)

# also works with nested groups
for key in cache.group("some-group"):
  print(cache[key])
```
