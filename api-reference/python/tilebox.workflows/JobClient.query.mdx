```python
def JobClient.query(
    temporal_extent: TimeIntervalLike | IDIntervalLike,
    automation_id: UUID | None = None,
) -> list[Job]
```

Query jobs in the specified interval.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="temporal_extent" type="TimeIntervalLike | IDIntervalLike" required>
  The temporal extent to filter jobs by. If an `IDInterval` is given, jobs are filtered by their job id instead of their creation time.
    It can be specified in the following ways:
    - TimeInterval: interval -> Use the time interval as its given
    - DatetimeScalar: [time, time] -> Construct a TimeInterval with start and end time set to the given
        value and the end time inclusive
    - tuple of two DatetimeScalar: [start, end) -> Construct a TimeInterval with the given start and
        end time
    - `IDInterval`: interval -> Use the ID interval as its given
    - tuple of two UUIDs: [start, end) -> Construct an `IDInterval` with the given start and end id
    - tuple of two strings: [start, end) -> Construct an `IDInterval` with the given start and end id
        parsed from the strings
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="automation_id" type="UUID | None">
  The automation id to filter jobs by. If not provided, jobs from all automations are returned.
</ParamField>

## Returns

A list of jobs.
