You can list all the collections available for a dataset using the `collections` method on the dataset object.

<RequestExample>

```python Python (Sync)
collections = dataset.collections(
    availability = True,
    count = False,
)
```

```python Python (Async)
collections = await dataset.collections(
    availability = True,
    count = False,
)
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="availability" type="bool">
  Include the availability interval for each collection. The availability interval is a time interval with a start time
  of the first available data point and an end time of the last available data point in a collection. Defaults to
  `True`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count" type="bool">
  Include the number of data points for each collection. Producing an exact count requires a full scan of each
  collection, which can be slow for large collections. Defaults to `False`.
</ParamField>
