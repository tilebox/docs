You can access information such as availability and number of available datapoints using the info method on a collection object.

<RequestExample>

```python Python (Sync)
info = collection.info(
    availability = True,
    count = False,
)
```

```python Python (Async)
info = await collection.info(
    availability = True,
    count = False,
)
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="availability" type="bool">
  Include the availability interval in the info response. The availability interval is a time interval with a start time
  of the first available data point and an end time of the last available data point in a collection. Defaults to
  `True`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count" type="bool">
  Include the number of data points in the info response. Producing an exact count requires a full scan of the
  collection, which can be slow for large collections. Defaults to `False`.
</ParamField>

## Errors

<ParamField path="NotFoundError" type="No such collection Non-existent-Collection">
  If the collection doesn't exist in the dataset.
</ParamField>
