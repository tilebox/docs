    ## Spatio-Temporal datasets

    <Frame>
    ![Spatio-Temporal Datasets](/assets/changelog/2025-04-spatio-temporal.png)
    </Frame>

    Spatio-temporal datasets are officially out, fully supported in all languages and available as a category to create in custom datasets!

    The core problems that spatio-temporal datasets solve are

    - finding relevant data quickly (e.g. all Sentinel 2 granules along the US coastline, last year),
    - storing auxiliary geographically coded data (e.g. weather station data, ground truth data),
    - cataloging higher level data and results

    [Here's a short video](https://share.descript.com/view/khO3QJslhgU) on performance and core capabilities.

    We're excited about this as cataloging has until now been an unsexy but hard problem, and it's great to finally have a solution out there

    ## Custom Datasets

    <Frame>
    ![Custom datasets](/assets/changelog/2025-03-custom-datasets.png)
    </Frame>

    Create your own custom datasets!

    - statically typed
    - with clients in Python and Go

    Use it to organize anything from telemetry, raw payload metadata, auxiliary sensor data, configuration data, or
    internal data catalogs.

    **Quickstart**
    1. Specify the data type in the Console
    2. Create a collection
    3. Use client.ingest() to ingest a `xarray.Dataset` or `pandas.DataFrame`
    4. Query away!

    For detailed instructions, check out the [Creating a dataset](/guides/datasets/create) how-to guide.
