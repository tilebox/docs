Through the usage of `xarray` and `pandas` you can also easily ingest existing datasets available in file
formats, such as CSV, [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), [Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) and more.

## CSV

Comma-separated values (CSV) is a common file format for tabular data. It's widely used in data science. Tilebox
supports CSV ingestion using the `pandas.read_csv` function.

Assuming you have a CSV file named `data.csv` with the following content. If you want to follow along, you can
download the file [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tbx-web-assets-2bad228/docs/data-samples/ingestion_data.csv).

```csv ingestion_data.csv
time,value,sensor,precise_time,sensor_history,some_unwanted_column
2025-03-28T11:44:23Z,45.16,A,2025-03-28T11:44:23.345761444Z,"[-12.15, 13.45, -8.2, 16.5, 45.16]","Unsupported"
2025-03-28T11:45:19Z,273.15,B,2025-03-28T11:45:19.128742312Z,"[300.16, 280.12, 273.15]","Unsupported"
```

This data already conforms to the schema of the `MyCustomDataset` dataset, except for `some_unwanted_column` which
you want to drop before you ingest it. Here is how this could look like:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("ingestion_data.csv")
data = data.drop(columns=["some_unwanted_column"])

collection = dataset.get_or_create_collection("CSVMeasurements")
collection.ingest(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parquet

[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Tilebox supports Parquet ingestion using the `pandas.read_parquet` function.

The parquet file used in this example [is available here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tbx-web-assets-2bad228/docs/data-samples/ingestion_data.parquet).

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_parquet("ingestion_data.parquet")

# our data already conforms to the schema of the MyCustomDataset
# dataset, so lets ingest it
collection = dataset.get_or_create_collection("ParquetMeasurements")
collection.ingest(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Feather

[Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) is a file format originating from the Apache Arrow project,
designed for storing tabular data in a fast and memory-efficient way. It's supported by many programming languages,
including Python. Tilebox supports Feather ingestion using the `pandas.read_feather` function.

The feather file used in this example [is available here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tbx-web-assets-2bad228/docs/data-samples/ingestion_data.feather).

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_feather("ingestion_data.feather")

# our data already conforms to the schema of the MyCustomDataset
# dataset, so lets ingest it
collection = dataset.get_or_create_collection("FeatherMeasurements")
collection.ingest(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

## GeoParquet

Please check out the [Ingesting data](/guides/datasets/ingest) guide for an example of ingesting a GeoParquet file.
