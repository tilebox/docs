## Tilebox languages and SDKs

Tilebox supports multiple languages and SDKs for running workflows.
All Tilebox SDKs and workflows are designed to be interoperable, which means it's possible to have a workflow where individual tasks are executed in different languages.
Check out [Languages & SDKs](/sdks/introduction) to learn more about currently available programming SDKs.

## Why multi-language workflows?

You might need to use multiple languages in a single workflow for many reasons, such as:

- You want to use a language that is better suited for a specific task (for example Python for data processing, Go for a backend API)
- You want to use a library that is only available in a specific language (for example xarray in Python)
- You started prototyping in Python, but need to start migrating the compute-intensive parts of your workflow to a different language for performance reasons

## Multi-language workflow example

This guide will tackle the first use case: you have a tasking server in Go and want to offload some of the processing to Python.

## Defining tasks in Python and Go

```python Python
class ScheduleImageCapture(Task):
    # The input parameters must match the ones defined in the Go task
    location: tuple[float, float]  # lat_lon
    resolution_m: int
    spectral_bands: list[float]  # spectral bands in nm

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        # Here you can implement your task logic, submit subtasks, etc.
        print(f"Image captured for {self.location} with {self.resolution_m}m resolution and bands {self.spectral_bands}")

    @staticmethod
    def identifier() -> tuple[str, str]:
        # The identifier must match the one defined in the Go task
        return "tilebox.com/schedule_image_capture", "v1.0"
```

```go Go
type ScheduleImageCapture struct {
    // json tags must match the Python task definition
    Location      [2]float64 `json:"location"` // lat_lon
    ResolutionM   int        `json:"resolution_m"`
    SpectralBands []float64  `json:"spectral_bands"` // spectral bands in nm
}

// No need to define the Execute method since we're only submitting the task

// Identifier must match with the task identifier in the Python runner
func (t *ScheduleImageCapture) Identifier() workflows.TaskIdentifier {
    return workflows.NewTaskIdentifier("tilebox.com/schedule_image_capture", "v1.0")
}
```

A couple important points to note:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Input parameters">
    The dataclass parameters in Python must match the struct fields in Go, including the types and the names (through the JSON tags in Go).
    
    Due to Go and Python having different naming conventions, it's recommended to use JSON tags in the Go struct to match the Python dataclass field names to respect the language-specific conventions.
    
    Go fields must start with an uppercase letter to be serialized to JSON.

    <Note>
    The need for JSON tags in the preceding Go code is currently necessary but might be removed in the future.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execute method">
    The execute method is defined in the Python task but not in the Go task since Go will only be used to submit the task, not executing it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Identifier">
    It's necessary to define the `identifier` method in both the Python and Go tasks and to make sure they match.
    The `identifier` method has two values, the first being an arbitrary unique task identifier and the second being the version in the `v{major}.{minor}` format.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating a Go server that submits jobs

Write a simple HTTP tasking server in Go with a `/submit` endpoint that accepts requests to submit a `ScheduleImageCapture` job.

<Note>
    Both Go and Python code are using `test-cluster-tZD9Ca2qsqt4V` as the cluster slug. You should replace it with your own cluster slug, which you can create in the [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com/workflows/clusters).
</Note>

```go Go
func main() {
    log.Println("Server starting on http://localhost:8080")

    client := workflows.NewClient()
    http.HandleFunc("/submit", submitHandler(client))
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

// Submit a job based on some query parameters
func submitHandler(client *workflows.Client) http.HandlerFunc {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        latArg := r.URL.Query().Get("lat")
        lonArg := r.URL.Query().Get("lon")
        resolutionArg := r.URL.Query().Get("resolution")
        bandsArg := r.URL.Query().Get("bands[]")

        latFloat, err := strconv.ParseFloat(latArg, 64)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }
        lonFloat, err := strconv.ParseFloat(lonArg, 64)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }

        resolutionM, err := strconv.Atoi(resolutionArg)
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }

        var spectralBands []float64
        for _, bandArg := range strings.Split(bandsArg, ",") {
            band, err := strconv.ParseFloat(bandArg, 64)
            if err != nil {
                http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
                return
            }
            spectralBands = append(spectralBands, band)
        }

        job, err := client.Jobs.Submit(r.Context(), "Schedule Image capture",
            []workflows.Task{
                &ScheduleImageCapture{
                    Location:      [2]float64{latFloat, lonFloat},
                    ResolutionM:   resolutionM,
                    SpectralBands: spectralBands,
                },
            },
        )
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
            return
        }

        _, _ = io.WriteString(w, fmt.Sprintf("Job submitted: %s\n", job.ID))
    }
}
```

<Note>
    In the same way that you can submit jobs across languages you can also submit subtasks across languages.
</Note>

## Creating a Python runner

Write a Python script that starts a task runner and registers the `ScheduleImageCapture` task.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

def main():
    client = Client()
    runner = client.runner(tasks=[ScheduleImageCapture])
    runner.run_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Testing it

Start the Go server.

```bash Shell
go run .
```

In another terminal, start the Python runner.

```bash Shell
uv run runner.py
```

Submit a job to the Go server.

```bash Shell
curl http://localhost:8080/submit?lat=40.75&lon=-73.98&resolution=30&bands[]=489.0,560.6,666.5
```

Check the Python runner output, it should print the following line:

```plaintext Output
Image captured for [40.75, -73.98] with 30m resolution and bands [489, 560.6, 666.5]
```

As a learning exercise, you can try to change the [News API Workflow](/workflows/concepts/tasks#dependencies-example) to replace the `FetchNews` task with a Go task and keep all the other tasks in Python.
You'll learn how to submit a subtask in another language than what the current task is executed in.
