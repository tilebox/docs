If after cancelling a job you want to resume it, you can [retry](/api-reference/workflows/retrying-job) it to undo the cancellation.

```python Python (Sync)
job_client.cancel(job)
```

```python Python (Async)
await job_client.cancel(job)
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="job" type="Job">
