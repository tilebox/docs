Tilebox not only provides access to your own, private datasets but also to a growing number of public datasets. These datasets are available to all users of Tilebox and are a great way to get started and prototype your applications even before data from your own satellites is available.

<Note>
  If there is a public dataset you would like to see in Tilebox, 
  <a href="mailto:support@tilebox.com">please get in touch</a>.

## Accessing Open Data through Tilebox

Accessing open datasets in Tilebox is straightforward and as easy as accessing your own datasets. Tilebox has already ingested the required metadata for each available dataset, so you can query, preview, and download the data seamlessly. This setup enables you to leverage performance optimizations and simplifies your workflows.

By using the [datasets API](/datasets), you can start prototyping your applications and workflows easily.

## Available datasets

<Tip>
  The Tilebox Console contains in-depth descriptions of each dataset. Check out the [Sentinel 5P Tropomi](https://console.tilebox.com/datasets/explorer/feb2bcc9-8fdf-4714-8a63-395ee9d3f323?view=documentation) documentation as an example.

### Copernicus Data Space

The [Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) is an open ecosystem that provides free instant access to data and services from the Copernicus Sentinel missions.

Tilebox currently supports the following datasets from the Copernicus Data Space:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sentinel 1">
  The Sentinel-1 mission is the European Radar Observatory for the Copernicus
  joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space
  Agency (ESA). The Sentinel-1 mission includes C-band imaging operating in
  four exclusive imaging modes with different resolution (down to 5 m) and
  coverage (up to 400 km). It provides dual polarization capability, short
  revisit times and rapid product delivery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sentinel 2">
  Sentinel-2 is equipped with an optical instrument payload that samples 13
  spectral bands: four bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60
  m spatial resolution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sentinel 3">
  Sentinel-3 is equipped with multiple instruments whose data is available in Tilebox.

  `OLCI` (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) is an optical instrument used to provide
  data continuity for ENVISAT MERIS.

  `SLSTR` (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) is a dual-view scanning
  temperature radiometer, which flies in low Earth orbit (800 - 830 km
  altitude).

  The `SRAL` (SAR Radar Altimeter) instrument comprises one nadir-looking antenna,
  and a central electronic chain composed of a Digital Processing Unit (DPU)
  and a Radio Frequency Unit (RFU).

  OLCI, in conjunction with the SLSTR instrument, provides the `SYN` products,
  providing continuity with SPOT VEGETATION.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sentinel 5P">
  The primary goal of `TROPOMI` is to provide daily global observations of key
  atmospheric constituents related to monitoring and forecasting air quality,
  the ozone layer, and climate change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Landsat 8">
  Landsat-8 is part of the long-running Landsat programme led by USGS and NASA and
  carries the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor
  (TIRS). The Operational Land Imager (OLI), on board Landsat-8 measures in
  the VIS, NIR and SWIR portions of the spectrum. Its images have 15 m
  panchromatic and 30 m multi-spectral spatial resolutions along a 185 km wide
  swath, covering wide areas of the Earth's landscape while providing
  high enough resolution to distinguish features like urban centres, farms,
  forests and other land uses. The entire Earth falls within view once every
  16 days due to Landsat-8's near-polar orbit. The Thermal Infra-Red Sensor
  instrument, on board Landsat-8, is a thermal imager operating in pushbroom
  mode with two Infra-Red channels: 10.8 µm and 12 µm with 100 m spatial
  resolution.
  </Accordion>

### Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)

The [Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)](https://asf.alaska.edu/) is a NASA-funded research center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ASF supports a wide variety of research and applications using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and related remote sensing technologies.

Tilebox currently supports the following datasets from the Alaska Satellite Facility:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ERS SAR">
  European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Granules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Umbra Space

[Umbra](https://umbra.space/) satellites provide up to 16 cm resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from space. The Umbra Open Data Program (ODP) features over twenty diverse time-series locations that are frequently updated, allowing users to explore SAR's capabilities.

Tilebox currently supports the following datasets from Umbra Space:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Umbra SAR">
  Time-series SAR data provided as Opendata by Umbra Space.
