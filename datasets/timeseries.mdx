Time series datasets act as containers for data points. All data points in a dataset share the same type and fields.

Additionally, all time series datasets include a few [common fields](#common-fields). One of these fields, the `time` field, allows you to perform time-based data queries on a dataset.

## Listing datasets

You can use [your client instance](/datasets/introduction#creating-a-datasets-client) to access the datasets available to you. For example, to access the `sentinel1_sar` dataset in the `open_data.copernicus` dataset group, use the following code.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()
dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel1_sar
```
</CodeGroup>

Once you have your dataset object, you can use it to [list the available collections](/datasets/collections) for the dataset.

<Tip>
  If you're using an IDE or an interactive environment with auto-complete, you can use it on your client instance to discover the datasets available to you. Type `client.` and trigger auto-complete after the dot to do so.
</Tip>

## Common fields

While the specific data fields between different time series datasets can vary, there are common fields that all time series datasets share.

<ParamField path="time" type="datetime">
  The timestamp associated with each data point. Tilebox uses millisecond precision for storing and indexing data points. Timestamps are always in UTC.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
  A [universally unique identifier (UUID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) that uniquely identifies each data point. IDs are generated so that sorting them lexicographically also sorts them by their time field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ingestion_time" type="datetime">
  The time the data point was ingested into the Tilebox API. Timestamps are always in UTC.
</ParamField>

These fields are present in all time series datasets. Together, they make up the metadata of a data point. Each dataset also has its own set of fields that are specific to that dataset.

<Note>
  Tilebox uses millisecond precision timestamps for storing and indexing data points. If multiple data points share the same timestamp within one millisecond, they will all display the same timestamp. Each data point can have any number of timestamp fields with a higher precision. For example, telemetry data commonly includes timestamp fields with nanosecond precision.
</Note>

## Example data point

Below is an example data point from a time series dataset represented as an [`xarray.Dataset`](/sdks/python/xarray). It contains the common fields. When using the Tilebox Python client library, you receive the data in this format.

```plaintext Example timeseries datapoint
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:         ()
Coordinates:
    time            datetime64[ns] 2023-03-12 16:45:23.532
    id              <U36 '0186d6b6-66cc-fcfd-91df-bbbff72499c3'
    ingestion_time   datetime64[ns] 2023-03-12 19:53:12.742
Data variables:
    *empty*
```

<Note>
    The datatype `<U36` represents a string of **U**nicode characters with a maximum length of 36.
