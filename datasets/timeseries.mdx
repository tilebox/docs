Time series datasets are a container for individual data points.
All data points within a time series dataset share the same data type, they share the same set of fields.

Additionally all time series datasets share a few [common fields](#common-fields).
One of those, the `time` field enables you to perform time-based data queries on a dataset.

## Overview

Here is a quick overview of the API for listing and accessing datasets which this page covers.
Some usage examples for different use-cases are provided below.

| Method                                        | API Reference                                                    | Description                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `client.datasets`                             | [Listing datasets](/api-reference/datasets/listing-datasets)     | List all available datasets. |
| `datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel1_sar` | [Accessing a dataset](/api-reference/datasets/accessing-dataset) | Access a specific dataset.   |

## Listing datasets

You can use [your Tilebox Python client instance](/datasets/introduction#creating-a-datasets-client) to access the datasets available to you.
For example, to access a dataset called dataset in a dataset group called some, you can use the following code.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client()
    datasets = client.datasets()
    dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel1_sar
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.datasets.aio import Client

    client = Client()
    datasets = await client.datasets()
    dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel1_sar
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Once you have your dataset object, you can then use it to [list the available collections](/datasets/collections) for
the dataset.

<Note>
  Tip: if you're using an IDE or an interactive environment with auto-complete you can use it on your client instance to
  discover the datasets that are available to you. Type `client.` and trigger auto-complete after the dot to do so.
</Note>

## Common Fields

While the actual data fields between data points of different time series datasets can vary greatly, there are common
fields that all time series datasets share.

<ParamField path="time" type="datetime">
  The timestamp associated with each data point. Tilebox uses a milli-second precision for storing and indexing data
  points. Timestamps are always in UTC.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
  A [Universally_unique_identifier (UUID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) which uniquely
  identifies each datapoint. IDs are generated in such a way that sorting them lexicographically also means sorting them
  by their time field.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ingestion_time" type="datetime">
  The time the data point was ingested into the Tilebox API. Timestamps are always in UTC.
</ParamField>

These fields are present on all time series datasets. Together they make up the metadata of a datapoint.
Each dataset also have its own set of fields that are specific to that dataset.

<Note>
  Tilebox is using milli-second precision timestamps for storing and indexing data points. If there are data points
  within one milli-second, they share the same timestamp. Each data point can contain any number of timestamp fields
  with an arbitrarily higher precision. For telemetry data for example it's common to have timestamp fields using a
  nanosecond precision.
</Note>

## Example datapoint

Below is an example datapoint from a time series dataset in the form of an [`xarray.Dataset`](/sdks/python/xarray).
It contains the common fields. When using the Tilebox Python client library, you receive the data in this format.

```plaintext Example timeseries datapoint
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:         ()
Coordinates:
    time            datetime64[ns] 2023-03-12 16:45:23.532
    id              <U36 '0186d6b6-66cc-fcfd-91df-bbbff72499c3'
    ingestion_time   datetime64[ns] 2023-03-12 19:53:12.742
Data variables:
    *empty*
```

<Note>
    The datatype `<U36` represents a string of **U**nicode characters with a maximum length of 36.
