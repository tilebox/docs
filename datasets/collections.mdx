Collections are a way of grouping together data points from the same dataset. They are useful for representing
a logical grouping of data points that are commonly queried together. For example, if you have a dataset
that contains data from a specific instrument which is onboard different satellites, you may want to group the data
points from each satellite together into a collection.

## Overview

Here is a quick overview of the API for listing and accessing collections which is covered in this page.
Some usage examples for different use-cases are provided below.

| Method                | API Reference                                                          | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dataset.collections` | [Listing collections](/api-reference/datasets/listing-collection)      | List all available collections for a dataset. |
| `dataset.collection`  | [Accessing a collection](/api-reference/datasets/accessing-collection) | Access an individual collection by its name.  |
| `collection.info`     | [Collection information](/api-reference/datasets/collection-info)      | Request data information for a collection.    |

Check out the examples below for some common use-cases when working with collections. The examples
assume that you have already [created a client](/datasets/introduction#creating-a-datasets-client) and
[listed the available datasets](/api-reference/datasets/listing-datasets).

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client()
    datasets = client.datasets()
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.datasets.aio import Client

    client = Client()
    datasets = await client.datasets()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Listing collections

Each dataset has a list of collections associated with it. You can list the collections for a dataset using the
`collections` method on the dataset object.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python (Sync)
  dataset = datasets.open_data.asf.sentinel1_sar
  collections = dataset.collections()
  print(collections)
  ```
  
  ```python Python (Async)
  dataset = datasets.open_data.asf.sentinel1_sar
  collections = await dataset.collections()
  print(collections)
  ```

</CodeGroup>

```txt Output
{'Sentinel-1A': Collection Sentinel-1A: [2014-06-15T03:44:43.000 UTC, 2022-12-31T23:57:59.000 UTC] (1209636 data points),
 'Sentinel-1B': Collection Sentinel-1B: [2016-09-26T00:02:34.000 UTC, 2021-12-23T06:53:08.000 UTC] (657674 data points)}
```

The `collections` variable is a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the collections and the values are
the collection objects themselves. Each collection within a dataset has a unique name. When listing collections, you
can optionally also request the `availability` of each collection. This returns the time range for which data points
are available in the collection. This is useful for determining which collections contain data points for a specific
time range. You can request the availability by passing `availability=True` to the `collections` method (which is set by default).

Additionally you can also request the number of data points in each collection by passing `count=True` to the `collections`
method.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python (Sync)
  dataset = datasets.open_data.asf.sentinel1_sar
  collections = dataset.collections(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collections)
  ```
  
  ```python Python (Async)
  dataset = datasets.open_data.asf.sentinel1_sar
  collections = await dataset.collections(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collections)
  ```

</CodeGroup>

```txt Output
{'Sentinel-1A': Collection Sentinel-1A: [2014-06-15T03:44:43.000 UTC, 2022-12-31T23:57:59.000 UTC] (1209636 data points),
 'Sentinel-1B': Collection Sentinel-1B: [2016-09-26T00:02:34.000 UTC, 2021-12-23T06:53:08.000 UTC] (657674 data points)}
```

## Accessing individual collections

If you have already listed the collections for a dataset using `dataset.collections()`, you can access a
specific collection by accessing the resulting dictionary of `collections()` with the name of an individual collection.
You can then use the `info()` method on the collection object to get information
(name, availability, and count) about the collection.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python (Sync)
  collections = dataset.collections()
  sat1 = collections["Sat-1"]
  collection_info = sat1.info(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collection_info)
  ```
  
  ```python Python (Async)
  collections = await dataset.collections()
  sat1 = collections["Sat-1"]
  collection_info = await sat1.info(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collection_info)
  ```

</CodeGroup>

```txt Output
Collection Sat-1: [2019-03-07T16:09:17.773000 UTC, 2021-05-23T19:17:23.472000 UTC] (910245 data points)
```

You can also access a specific collection by using the `collection` method on the dataset object as well.
This has the advantage that you can directly access the collection without having to list all collections first.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python (Sync)
  sat1 = dataset.collection("Sat-1")
  collection_info = sat1.info(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collection_info)
  ```
  
  ```python Python (Async)
  sat1 = dataset.collection("Sat-1")
  collection_info = await sat1.info(availability=True, count=True)
  print(collection_info)
  ```

</CodeGroup>

```txt Output
Collection Sat-1: [2019-03-07T16:09:17.773000 UTC, 2021-05-23T19:17:23.472000 UTC] (910245 data points)
```

## Errors you may encounter

### NotFoundError

If you try to access a collection with a name that does not exist, a `NotFoundError` error is raised. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python (Sync)
dataset.collection("Sat-X").info() # raises NotFoundError: 'No such collection Sat-X'
```

```python Python (Async)
await dataset.collection("Sat-X").info() # raises NotFoundError: 'No such collection Sat-X'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Summary

Great, now you know how to list and access collections. Next you can look at [how to query data points from a collection](/datasets/loading-data).
