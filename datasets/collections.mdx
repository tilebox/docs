Collections are a way of grouping together data points from the same dataset. They are useful for representing
a logical grouping of data points that are commonly queried together. For example, if you have a dataset
that contains data from a specific instrument which is onboard different satellites, you may want to group the data
points from each satellite together into a collection.

## Overview

Here is a quick overview of the API for listing and accessing collections which is covered in this page.
Some usage examples for different use-cases are provided below.

| Method                | API Reference                                                          | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dataset.collections` | [Listing collections](/api-reference/datasets/listing-collection)      | List all available collections for a dataset. |
| `dataset.collection`  | [Accessing a collection](/api-reference/datasets/accessing-collection) | Access an individual collection by its name.  |
| `collection.info`     | [Collection information](/api-reference/datasets/collection-info)      | Request data information for a collection.    |

Check out the examples below for some common use-cases when working with collections. The examples
assume that you have already [created a client](/datasets/introduction#creating-a-datasets-client) and
[listed the available datasets](/api-reference/datasets/listing-datasets).

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client()
    datasets = client.datasets()
    ```
    
</CodeGroup>

## Listing collections

Each dataset has a list of collections associated with it. You can list the collections for a dataset using the
`collections` method on the dataset object.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.landsat8_oli_tirs
  collections = dataset.collections()
  print(collections)
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
{'L1GT': Collection L1GT: [2013-03-25T12:08:43.699 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:57:32.456 UTC],
 'L1T': Collection L1T: [2013-03-26T09:33:19.763 UTC, 2020-08-24T03:21:50.000 UTC],
 'L1TP': Collection L1TP: [2013-03-24T00:25:55.457 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:58:20.229 UTC],
 'L2SP': Collection L2SP: [2015-01-01T07:53:35.391 UTC, 2024-08-12T12:52:03.243 UTC]}
```

The `collections` variable is a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the collections and the values are
the collection objects themselves. Each collection within a dataset has a unique name. When listing collections, you
can optionally also request the `availability` of each collection. This returns the time range for which data points
are available in the collection. This is useful for determining which collections contain data points for a specific
time range. You can request the availability by passing `availability=True` to the `collections` method (which is set by default).

Additionally you can also request the number of data points in each collection by passing `count=True` to the `collections`
method.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.landsat8_oli_tirs
  collections = dataset.collections()
  print(collections)
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
{'L1GT': Collection L1GT: [2013-03-25T12:08:43.699 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:57:32.456 UTC] (154288 data points),
 'L1T': Collection L1T: [2013-03-26T09:33:19.763 UTC, 2020-08-24T03:21:50.000 UTC] (87958 data points),
 'L1TP': Collection L1TP: [2013-03-24T00:25:55.457 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:58:20.229 UTC] (322041 data points),
 'L2SP': Collection L2SP: [2015-01-01T07:53:35.391 UTC, 2024-08-12T12:52:03.243 UTC] (191110 data points)}
```

## Accessing individual collections

If you have already listed the collections for a dataset using `dataset.collections()`, you can access a
specific collection by accessing the resulting dictionary of `collections()` with the name of an individual collection.
You can then use the `info()` method on the collection object to get information
(name, availability, and count) about the collection.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  collections = dataset.collections()
  terrain_correction = collections["L1GT"]
  collection_info = terrain_correction.info()
  print(collection_info)
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
L1GT: [2013-03-25T12:08:43.699 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:57:32.456 UTC] (154288 data points)
```

You can also access a specific collection by using the `collection` method on the dataset object as well.
This has the advantage that you can directly access the collection without having to list all collections first.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  terrain_correction = dataset.collection("L1GT")
  collection_info = terrain_correction.info()
  print(collection_info)
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
L1GT: [2013-03-25T12:08:43.699 UTC, 2024-08-19T12:57:32.456 UTC] (154288 data points)
```

## Errors you may encounter

### NotFoundError

If you try to access a collection with a name that does not exist, a `NotFoundError` error is raised. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
dataset.collection("Sat-X").info() # raises NotFoundError: 'No such collection Sat-X'
```

</CodeGroup>
