## Overview

This section provides an overview of the API for deleting data from a collection.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [`collection.delete`](/api-reference/python/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete) | Delete data points from a collection.                |

<Note>
  You need to have write permission on the collection to be able to delete datapoints.
</Note>

Check out the examples below for common scenarios of deleting data from a collection.

## Deleting data by datapoint IDs

To delete data from a collection, use the [delete](/api-reference/python/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete) method. This method accepts a list of datapoint IDs to delete.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()
collections = datasets.my_custom_dataset.collections()
collection = collections["Sensor-1"]

n_deleted = collection.delete([
  "0195c87a-49f6-5ffa-e3cb-92215d057ea6",
  "0195c87b-bd0e-3998-05cf-af6538f34957",
])

print(f"Deleted {n_deleted} data points.")
```
</CodeGroup>
<CodeOutputHeader />
<CodeGroup>
```plaintext Output
Deleted 2 data points.
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  `delete` not only takes a list of datapoint IDs as string, but supports a wide range of other useful input types as well.
  See the [delete](/api-reference/python/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete) API documentation for more details.
</Tip>

### Possible errors

- `NotFoundError`: raised if one of the data points is not found in the collection. If any of the data points are not found,
  nothing will be deleted
- `ValueError`: raised if one of the specified ids is not a valid UUID

## Deleting a time interval

One common way to delete data is to first load it from a collection and then forward it to the `delete` method. For
this use case it often is a good idea to query the datapoints with `skip_data=True` to avoid loading the data fields,
since you only need the datapoint IDs. See [fetching only metadata](/datasets/query#fetching-only-metadata) for more details.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
to_delete = collection.load(("2023-05-01", "2023-06-01"), skip_data=True)

n_deleted = collection.delete(datapoints)
print(f"Deleted {n_deleted} data points.")
```
</CodeGroup>
<CodeOutputHeader />
<CodeGroup>
```plaintext Output
Deleted 104 data points.
```
</CodeGroup>
