## Overview

This section provides an overview of the API for ingesting and deleting data from a collection. It includes usage examples for many common scenarios.

| Method                  | API Reference                                                                        | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `collection.delete`     | [Deleting data points](/api-reference/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete)            | Delete data points from a collection.                |
| `collection.delete_ids` | [Deleting data points by IDs](/api-reference/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete_ids) | Delete data points from a collection by their ids.   |

<Note>
  You need to have write permission on the collection to be able to ingest or delete datapoints.
</Note>

Check out the examples below for common scenarios when ingesting and deleting data from collections.
The examples assume you have already [created a client](/datasets/introduction#creating-a-datasets-client) and [accessed a specific dataset collection](/datasets/collections) that you have write permissions on.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()
collections = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel1_sar.collections()
collection = collections["S1A_IW_RAW__0S"]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Ingesting data


## Deleting data

To delete data from a collection, use the [delete](/api-reference/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete) or [delete_ids](/api-reference/tilebox.datasets/Collection.delete_ids) method.

One common way to delete data is to load it from a collection and then forward it to the `delete` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
datapoints = collection.load(("2023-05-01", "2023-06-01"))

n_deleted = collection.delete(datapoints)
print(f"Deleted {n_deleted} data points.")
```
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
Deleted 104 data points.
```

In case you already have the list of datapoint IDs that you want to delete, you can use the `delete_ids` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from uuid import UUID

datapoints_ids=[
  UUID("29b29ade-db02-427a-be9c-a8ef8184f544"),
  UUID("fa4a8e4e-6afe-41a3-b228-b867330669bd"),
]

n_deleted = collection.delete_ids(datapoints_ids)
print(f"Deleted {n_deleted} data points.")
```
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
Deleted 2 data points.
```
