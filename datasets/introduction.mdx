As the name suggests, time series datasets refer to a certain kind of datasets where each data point is associated with a timestamp.
This is a common format for datasets that are collected over time, such as satellite data.

This section covers:

- [Which timeseries datasets are available](/datasets/timeseries#listing-datasets) and how to list them
- [Which common fields](/datasets/timeseries#common-fields) all time series datasets share
- [What collections are](/datasets/collections) and how to access them
- [How to access data](/datasets/loading-data) from a collection for a given time interval

<Note>
  If you want to quickly look up the name of some API method or the meaning of a specific parameter [check out the
  complete time series API Reference](/api-reference/datasets/).

## Terminology

Here are some terms used throughout this section.

- **Data points**: time series data points are the individual entities that make up a dataset. Each data point is associated with a timestamp.
  Each data point consists of a set of fixed [metadata fields](/datasets/timeseries#common-fields) as well as individual fields that are defined on a dataset level.
- **Datasets**: time series datasets are a container for individual data points. All data points in a time series dataset share the same data type, so all
  data points in a dataset share the same set of fields.
- **Collections**: Collections are a way of grouping data points within a dataset. They are useful for representing a logical grouping of data points that are commonly queried together.

## Creating a datasets Client

Prerequisites

- You've [installed](/sdks/python/installation) the `tilebox-datasets` package
- You've [created](/authentication) a Tilebox API key

With the prerequisites out of the way, you can now create a client instance to start interacting with your Tilebox Datasets.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.datasets.aio import Client

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
    ```

</CodeGroup>

As an alternative, you can also set the `TILEBOX_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key and instantiate the client
without passing the `token` argument. Python automatically pick up the environment variable and use it to authenticate with the API.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    # requires a TILEBOX_API_KEY environment variable
    client = Client()
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.datasets.aio import Client

    # requires a TILEBOX_API_KEY environment variable
    client = Client()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Tilebox datasets offers a standard synchronous API by default, but also give you the option of an async client if you need it.

The synchronous client is great for data exploration in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks.
The asynchronous client is great for building production ready applications that need to scale. To find out more
about the differences between the two clients, check out the [Async support](/sdks/python/async) page.

### Exploring datasets

Now that you have a client instance, you can start exploring the datasets that are available. An easy way to do this
is to [list all datasets](/api-reference/datasets/listing-datasets) and then using the autocomplete capability
of your IDE or inside your Jupyter notebook.

<CodeGroup>
 
```python Python (Sync)
datasets = client.datasets()
datasets. # trigger autocomplete here to get an overview of the available datasets
```

```python Python (Async)
datasets = await client.datasets()
datasets. # trigger autocomplete here to get an overview of the available datasets
```

</CodeGroup>

### Errors you might encounter

#### AuthenticationError

`AuthenticationError` is raised when the client is unable to authenticate with the Tilebox API. This can happen when
the provided API key is invalid or expired. Instantiating a client with an invalid API key does not raise an error
directly, but only when you try to make a request to the API.

<CodeGroup>
 
```python Python (Sync)
client = Client(token="invalid-key") # runs without error
datasets = client.datasets() # raises AuthenticationError
```

```python Python (Async)
client = Client(token="invalid-key") # runs without error
datasets = await client.datasets() # raises AuthenticationError
```

</CodeGroup>
