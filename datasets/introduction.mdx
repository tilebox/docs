As the name suggests, time series datasets refer to a certain kind of datasets where each data point is associated with a timestamp.
This is a common format for datasets that are collected over time, such as satellite data.

This section covers:

## Terminology

Here are some terms used throughout this section.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data points">
    Time series data points are the individual entities that make up a dataset. Each data point is associated with a
    timestamp. Each data point consists of a set of fixed [metadata fields](/datasets/timeseries#common-fields) as well
    as individual fields that are defined on a dataset level.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Datasets">
    Time series datasets are a container for individual data points. All data points in a time series dataset share the
    same data type, so all data points in a dataset share the same set of fields.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collections">
    Collections are a way of grouping data points within a dataset. They are useful for representing a logical grouping
    of data points that are commonly queried together.

## Creating a datasets Client

Prerequisites

- You've [installed](/sdks/python/install) the `tilebox-datasets` package
- You've [created](/authentication) a Tilebox API key

With the prerequisites out of the way, you can now create a client instance to start interacting with your Tilebox Datasets.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
    ```

</CodeGroup>

As an alternative, you can also set the `TILEBOX_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key and instantiate the client
without passing the `token` argument. Python automatically pick up the environment variable and use it to authenticate with the API.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    # requires a TILEBOX_API_KEY environment variable
    client = Client()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Tilebox datasets offers a standard synchronous API by default, but also give you the option of an async client if you need it.

The synchronous client is great for data exploration in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks.
The asynchronous client is great for building production ready applications that need to scale. To find out more
about the differences between the two clients, check out the [Async support](/sdks/python/async) page.

### Exploring datasets

Now that you have a client instance, you can start exploring the datasets that are available. An easy way to do this
is to [list all datasets](/api-reference/datasets/listing-datasets) and then using the autocomplete capability
of your IDE or inside your Jupyter notebook.

<CodeGroup>
 
```python Python
datasets = client.datasets()
datasets. # trigger autocomplete here to get an overview of the available datasets
```

</CodeGroup>

### Errors you might encounter

#### AuthenticationError

`AuthenticationError` is raised when the client is unable to authenticate with the Tilebox API. This can happen when
the provided API key is invalid or expired. Instantiating a client with an invalid API key does not raise an error
directly, but only when you try to make a request to the API.

<CodeGroup>
 
```python Python
client = Client(token="invalid-key") # runs without error
datasets = client.datasets() # raises AuthenticationError
```

</CodeGroup>
