Time series datasets refer to datasets where each data point is linked to a timestamp. This format is common for data collected over time, such as satellite data.

## Terminology

Get familiar with some key terms when working with time series datasets.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data points">
    Time series data points are individual entities that form a dataset. Each data point has a timestamp and consists of a set of fixed [metadata fields](/datasets/timeseries#common-fields) along with dataset-specific fields.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Datasets">
    Time series datasets act as containers for data points. All data points in a dataset share the same type and fields.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collections">
    Collections group data points within a dataset. They help represent logical groupings of data points that are often queried together.

## Creating a datasets client

Prerequisites

- You have [installed](/sdks/python/install) the `tilebox-datasets` package.
- You have [created](/authentication) a Tilebox API key.

After meeting these prerequisites, you can create a client instance to interact with Tilebox Datasets.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Alternatively, you can set the `TILEBOX_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. You can then instantiate the client without passing the `token` argument. Python will automatically use this environment variable for authentication.

<CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    # requires a TILEBOX_API_KEY environment variable
    client = Client()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Tilebox datasets provide a standard synchronous API by default but also offers an [asynchronous client](/sdks/python/async) if needed.
</Tip>

### Exploring datasets

After creating a client instance, you can start exploring available datasets. A straightforward way to do this in an interactive environment is to [list all datasets](/api-reference/tilebox.datasets/Client.datasets) and use the autocomplete feature in your Jupyter notebook.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
datasets = client.datasets()
datasets. # trigger autocomplete here to view available datasets
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The Console also provides an [overview](https://console.tilebox.com/datasets/explorer) of all available datasets.
</Tip>

### Errors you might encounter

#### AuthenticationError

`AuthenticationError` occurs when the client fails to authenticate with the Tilebox API. This may happen if the provided API key is invalid or expired. A client instantiated with an invalid API key won't raise an error immediately, but an error will occur when making a request to the API.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client = Client(token="invalid-key") # runs without error
datasets = client.datasets() # raises AuthenticationError
```
</CodeGroup>
