<Accordion title="What is a Task Runner?">
Task Runners are the execution agents within the Tilebox Workflows ecosystem that carry out the tasks. Task runners can be
deployed in different compute environments, including on-premise servers and cloud-based auto-scaling clusters. They are
responsible for executing tasks as scheduled by the workflow orchestrator, ensuring that each task has the necessary resources
and environment to run effectively.

## Implementing a Task Runner

Practically speaking, a task runner is a continuously running process that listens for new tasks to execute. More than one
such task runner processes can be started to execute tasks concurrently.
Once a task runner receives a task, it executes it and then report the results back to the workflow orchestrator.
The task runner also handles any errors that occur during task execution, and reports these back to the orchestrator as well.

In order for a task to be executed, there must at least be one task runner running and available to execute the task.
Otherwise, tasks remain in a queue until an eligible task runner becomes available.

Implementing a task runner consists of the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connecting to the Tilebox Workflows API">
    Instantiate a client connected to the Tilebox Workflows API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting a cluster">
    Select or create a [cluster](/workflows/clusters) and then specify it's slug when creating a task runner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Registering tasks">
    To register tasks, you need to specify the task classes that the task runner can execute as a list to the `runner` method.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Listening for new tasks">
    To listen for new tasks until the task runner process is shut down call the `run_forever` method of the task runner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A simple example of those steps put together might look like this:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python (Sync)

from tilebox.workflows import Client
# your own workflow:
from my_workflow import MyTask, OtherTask

def main():
    client = Client()  # 1. connect to the Tilebox Workflows API
    cluster = "dev-cluster"  # 2. select a cluster to join
    runner = client.runner(
        cluster,
        tasks=[MyTask, OtherTask]  # 3. register tasks
    )
    runner.run_forever()  # 4. listen for new tasks to execute

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```python Python (Async)
import asyncio
from tilebox.workflows.aio import Client
# your own workflow:
from my_workflow import MyTask, OtherTask

async def main():
    client = Client()  # 1. connect to the Tilebox Workflows API
    cluster = "dev-cluster"  # 2. select a cluster to join
    runner = await client.runner(
        cluster,
        tasks=[MyTask, OtherTask]  # 3. register tasks
    )
    await runner.run_forever()  # 4. listen for new tasks to execute

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

To now start the task runner locally, simply run it as a Python script:

```bash
> python task_runner.py
```

## Task Selection

In order for a task runner to pick up a submitted task, there are certain conditions that must be met:

1. The [cluster](/workflows/clusters) that a task was submitted to must match the task runner's cluster
2. The task runner must have a registered task matching the [task identifier](/workflows/tasks#task-identifiers) of the submitted task
3. The version of the task runner's registered task must be [compatible](/workflows/tasks#semantic-versioning) with the submitted task's version

If there is a task that meets these conditions, the task runner picks it up and executes it. Otherwise, the task runner
idles until a matching task is submitted.

<Note>
    Often times there are many submitted tasks that match the conditions for a task runner to execute. In this case,
    the task runner picks one of the tasks to execute, and the remaining tasks remain in a queue until the selected
    task is executed or another task runner becomes available to execute them.
</Note>

## Parallelism

Many instances of a task runners can be started in parallel to execute tasks concurrently.
Each task runner listens for new tasks to execute, and executes tasks as they become available.
This allows for a high degree of parallelism, and can be used to scale the execution of tasks to handle large workloads.

For testing this out, you can run an arbitrary number of task runners in parallel on your local machine by running the task runner
script in different terminal windows. Or you can use a tool such as [call-in-parallel](https://github.com/tilebox/call-in-parallel)
to start the task runner script many times.

For example, to start 5 task runners in parallel, you can use the following command:
```bash
> call-in-parallel -n 5 -- python task_runner.py
```

## Deploying Task Runners

Since task runners are continuously running processes, they can be deployed in different compute environments. The only
prerequisite for deploying task runners is that they have access to the Tilebox Workflows API, and that they are
configured to join a specific cluster. Once this is met, task runners can be deployed in pretty much any
compute environment, including:

- On-premise servers
- cloud-based virtual machines
- cloud-based auto-scaling clusters

## Scaling

One of the key benefits of task runners is their **ability to scale, even while workflows are already running**. This means that
even tough a workflow is already being executed, new task runners can be started anytime and immediately begin picking up queued
tasks of the existing workflow to execute. It's not necessary for a whole processing cluster to be available at the start of a workflow,
as task runners can be started and stopped at any time.

This is especially useful in cloud-based environments, where task runners can be started and stopped automatically based on the current
workload, determined by metrics such as CPU usage. That scenario might look like this:

1. A single instance of a task runner is running in a cloud-based environment, and it's currently idling, waiting for new tasks to execute.
2. A large workload is submitted to the workflow orchestrator, and the task runner picks up the first task to execute.
3. The first task results in new sub-tasks being submitted to the orchestrator, and the task runner picks up these sub-tasks to execute as well.
4. Due to the large workload, the CPU usage of the task runner increases, and new instances of the task runner are automatically started by the cloud-based environment.
5. Newly started task runners immediately begin picking up queued tasks to execute, and the workload is distributed between all available task runners.
6. As the workload decreases, the CPU usage of the task runners decreases, and the cloud-based environment automatically stops task runners again.
7. The first task runner continues to execute the remaining tasks until the workload is complete.
8. The first task runner idles until new tasks are submitted to the orchestrator.

CPU usage based scaling is just one example of how task runners can be scaled. Other metrics, such as memory usage or
network bandwidth are also supported out of the box by cloud-based environments. Additionally, in a future release, a
configuration option to scale task runners based on custom metrics, such as the number of tasks in the queue, or the
number of tasks executed per second is planned.

## Distributed Execution

Another benefit of task runners is their ability to be distributed across different compute environments. Imagine a scenario where
some data is stored on-premise, and other data is available in a cloud environment. A workflow could now consist
of tasks that do some pre-processing of the on-premise data, filtering irrelevant data points, and then publishing
the data to the cloud. The workflow could then continue in the cloud, where the data is processed further and combined with
other data sources. In this scenario, task runners could be deployed in both the on-premise environment and the cloud environment,
and they would be able to pick up tasks from the same workflow, even though they are running in different environments.

Another scenario where distributed task runners are useful is when a workflow requires specific hardware for certain tasks.
For example, a workflow might require a task to be executed on a machine with a GPU, and another task to be executed on a machine
with a large amount of memory.

Below is an example of a distributed workflow:

<CodeGroup title="Distributed Workflow">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

    class DistributedWorkflow(Task):
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            download_task = context.submit_subtask(DownloadData())
            process_task = context.submit_subtask(ProcessData(), depends_on=[download_task])

    class DownloadData(Task):
        """
        Download a dataset and put it into a shared internal bucket
        Requires a good network connection for a high download bandwidth
        """
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass

    class ProcessData(Task):
        """
        Perform a compute intensive processing of a dataset
        The dataset needs to be available in an internal bucket
        Requires access to a GPU for optimal performance
        """
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.workflows.aio import Task, ExecutionContext

    class DistributedWorkflow(Task):
        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            download_task = context.submit_subtask(DownloadData())
            process_task = context.submit_subtask(ProcessData(), depends_on=[download_task])

    class DownloadData(Task):
        """
        Download a dataset and put it into a shared internal bucket
        Requires a good network connection for a high download bandwidth
        """
    async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass

    class ProcessData(Task):
        """
        Perform a compute intensive processing of a dataset
        The dataset needs to be available in an internal bucket
        Requires access to a GPU for optimal performance
        """
    async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass
    ```
</CodeGroup>

To achieve a distributed execution of this workflow, no single task runner capable of executing all three of the tasks is set up.
Instead, two task runners, each capable of executing one of the tasks are set up. The first task runner is set up in an environment
with a good network connection, and the second task runner is set up in an environment with access to a GPU. When the workflow is
executed, the first task runner picks up the `DownloadData` task, and the second task runner picks up the `ProcessData` task.
The `DistributedWorkflow` does not have any specific hardware requirements, so it can be registered for both runners, and it gets
executed by either one of them.

<CodeGroup title="Distributed Runners">
    ```python download_task_runner.py
    from tilebox.workflows import Client

    client = Client()
    high_network_speed_runner = client.runner(
        "dev-cluster",
        tasks=[DownloadData, DistributedWorkflow]
    )
    high_network_speed_runner.run_forever()
    ```
    ```python gpu_task_runner.py
    from tilebox.workflows import Client

    client = Client()
    gpu_runner = client.runner(
        "dev-cluster",
        tasks=[ProcessData, DistributedWorkflow]
    )
    gpu_runner.run_forever()
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Now, both `download_task_runner.py` and `gpu_task_runner.py`are started, in parallel, on different machines with the required hardware for each.
As soon as `DistributedWorkflow` is submitted, it runs on either of the task runners, and the sub-tasks are executed by the appropriate task runner.

In this example, since `ProcessData` depends on `DownloadData`, the GPU task runner idles until the download task is completed, and then
pick up the process task.

<Note>
    You could also differentiate between the task runners by specifying different [clusters](/workflows/clusters), and then specifying explicit
    clusters to run on when submitting sub-tasks. To learn more about this, and the use case for clusters, head over to the [Clusters](/workflows/clusters) section.
</Note>

## Task Failures

If an uncaught exception occurs during task execution, the task runner catches the exception and reports it back to the workflow orchestrator.
The orchestrator then marks the task as failed, which results [in a job cancellation](/workflows/jobs#cancellation). This is to prevent the execution
of further tasks in the job, which may not be relevant anymore, due to the failure of the task.

But a task failure does not mean that all the work done by the job so far is lost. If the failure is fixable, by either
fixing a bug in the task implementation, by providing the task with the necessary resources, or by just retrying it a second
time due to a flaky network connection, it may make sense to [retry](/workflows/jobs#retries) the job.

Retrying a job adds all failed tasks back to the queue, and a task runner may pick them up again and attempt to execute them. If task
execution then succeeds, the job continue as if nothing happened. If it fails again, the task is again marked as failed, and could be
retried again if desired.

In case a failure is fixable by modifying the task implementation, it's important to fix the bug and deploy the new
implementation to the [task runners](/workflows/task-runners) before retrying the job. Otherwise, a task runner with
the original, broken implementation may pick up the task again and fail again.

## Task idempotency

Since a task may be retried, it's possible that a task is executed more than once. Depending on where
in the execution of the task it failed, it may have already performed some side effects, such as writing to a database,
or sending a message to a queue. This is why it's important to make tasks [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).
A task is idempotent if it can be executed many times without changing the result beyond an initial successful execution.

One special case of idempotency is the submission of sub-tasks. Sub-tasks are submitted as one at the completion of a task. That means that
if a task fails after calling `context.submit_subtask`, and is then retried it's assured that it does not have any pending sub-tasks, and 
they can be safely submitted again.

## Runner Crashes

Tilebox Workflows has a built-in mechanism to handle even the case of task runners crashing unexpectedly. When a task
runner picks up a task to execute, it sends a heartbeat to the workflow orchestrator periodically while it's
executing the task. If the orchestrator does not receive a heartbeat from the task runner for a certain period of
time, the task is marked as failed and [retried](/workflows/jobs#retries) automatically, for up to 10 times. As a result, another
task runner can pick up the task and execute it, and the job continues as if nothing happened.

This handles even cases such as a power outage, a hardware failure or a dropped network connection, where the runner
is unable to report to the workflow orchestrator that the current task has now failed. No task ever remains in a
running state indefinitely.

## Observability

Task runners are continuously running processes, and it's important to observe their health and performance. Observability
can be achieved by collecting and analyzing logs, metrics, and traces from the task runners. Tilebox Workflows provides a
set of tools to easily collect and analyze these observability data. To learn how you can configure Task Runners to enable this,
head over to the [Observability](/workflows/observability) section.
