## Introduction

Tilebox Workflows can execute jobs in two ways: a one-time execution triggered by a user, typically a batch processing, and near-real-time execution based on specific external events. By defining trigger conditions, you can automatically submit jobs based on external events.

Tilebox Workflows currently supports the following trigger conditions:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
    <Card title="Cron Triggers" icon="clock" href="/workflows/near-real-time/cron" horizontal>
        Trigger jobs based on a Cron schedule.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Storage Event Triggers" icon="right-to-line" href="/workflows/near-real-time/storage-events" horizontal>
        Trigger jobs after objects are created or modified in a storage location such as a cloud bucket.
    </Card>

<Info>
    Dataset Event Triggers, which will trigger jobs when new data points are ingested into a Tilebox dataset, are on the roadmap. Stay tuned for updates.

## Recurrent Tasks

To create a trigger, define a special task that serves as a prototype. In response to a trigger condition met, this task will be submitted as a new job. Such tasks are referred to as recurrent tasks.

Each recurrent task has a [task identifier](/workflows/concepts/tasks#task-identifiers), a [version](/workflows/concepts/tasks#semantic-versioning), and [input parameters](/workflows/concepts/tasks#input-parameters), just like regular tasks.
Recurrent tasks also automatically provide a special `trigger` attribute that contains information about the event that initiated the task's execution.

## Recurrent Task Client

The Tilebox Workflows client includes a sub-client for managing recurrent tasks. You can create this sub-client by calling the `recurrent_tasks` method on the main client instance.

### Listing Registered Recurrent Tasks

To list all registered recurrent tasks, use the `all` method on the recurrent task client.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
recurrent_tasks = client.recurrent_tasks()

recurrent_tasks = recurrent_tasks.all()
print(recurrent_tasks)
```

```plaintext Output
[
    RecurrentTaskPrototype(
        name='Run MyCronTask every hour at 15 minutes past the hour',
        prototype=TaskSubmission(
            cluster_slug='dev-cluster',
            identifier=TaskIdentifier(name='MyCronTask', version='v0.0'),
            input=b'{"message": "Hello"},
            dependencies=[],
            display='MyCronTask',
            max_retries=0), 
        storage_event_triggers=[],
        cron_triggers=[CronTrigger(schedule='15 * * * *')],
    )
]
```

### Registering Recurrent Tasks

To register a recurrent task, use the `create_recurring_...` methods specific to each trigger type provided by the recurrent task client. Refer to the documentation for each trigger type for more details.

## Overview in the Tilebox Console

You can also use the Tilebox Console to manage recurrent tasks. Visit [the recurrent tasks section](https://console.tilebox.com/workflows/recurrent-tasks) to check it out.

You can also register new recurrent tasks or edit and delete existing ones directly from the console.
