## Introduction

Tilebox Workflows are not only capable of executing jobs once after they are submitted by a user, often also referred
to as batch-processing. Instead, it's also possible to execute jobs in near-real-time, by defining trigger conditions
that result in jobs being executed based on external events. This requires no changes in the actual workflow code - 
the task implementations - at all, instead it's just a different way of submitting jobs.

Tilebox Workflows currently supports the following trigger conditions:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
    <Card title="Cron Triggers" icon="clock" href="/workflows/near-real-time/cron" horizontal>
        Trigger jobs based on a Cron schedule.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Storage Event Triggers" icon="right-to-line" href="/workflows/near-real-time/storage-events" horizontal>
        Trigger jobs after objects are created or modified in a storage location.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
    Dataset Event Triggers, capable of triggering jobs because of new data points being ingested into a Tilebox dataset,
    are the next trigger type on the roadmap. Stay tuned for updates.

## Recurrent Tasks

To create such a trigger, a special task needs to be defined, that acts as prototype for the tasks that
are submitted as part of a job as response to a trigger. Such a task prototype is called a recurrent task.

Since a recurrent task acts as a prototype for an actual task that gets submitted, it has a [task identifier](/workflows/concepts/tasks#task-identifiers),
a [version](/workflows/concepts/tasks#semantic-versioning) and [input parameters](/workflows/concepts/tasks#input-parameters) just
like any other regular task would. Recurrent tasks additionally also have a special `trigger` parameter. It differs for each
instantiation of the recurrent task and contains information about the event that triggered the execution of the task.

## Recurrent task client

The Tilebox workflows client provides a sub-client for interacting with recurrent tasks. This client can be
instantiated by calling the `recurrent_tasks` method on the client instance.

### Listing registered recurrent tasks

To list all registered recurrent tasks, you can use the `all` method on the recurrent task client.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
recurrent_tasks = client.recurrent_tasks()

recurrent_tasks = recurrent_tasks.all()
print(recurrent_tasks)
```

```plaintext Output
[
    RecurrentTaskPrototype(
        name='Run MyCronTask every hour at 15 minutes past the hour',
        prototype=TaskSubmission(
            cluster_slug='dev-cluster',
            identifier=TaskIdentifier(name='MyCronTask', version='v0.0'),
            input=b'{"message": "Hello"},
            dependencies=[],
            display='MyCronTask',
            max_retries=0), 
        storage_event_triggers=[],
        cron_triggers=[CronTrigger(schedule='15 * * * *')],
    )
]
```

### Registering a recurrent tasks

To register a recurrent task, the recurrent task client provides `create_recurring_...` methods for each trigger type.
Check out the documentation of the individual trigger types for more details.

## Overview in the Tilebox Console

Other than using the Tilebox SDKs to list or register recurrent tasks, you can also manage them in the Tilebox Console.
Head over to [the Workflows tab](https://console.tilebox.com/workflows/recurrent-tasks) to check it out.

There, you'll find a list of all registered recurrent tasks.

Additionally, you'll be able to register new recurrent tasks or edit/delete existing ones.
