## Creating a Cron Task

Cron Tasks are recurrent tasks that are triggered on a [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) schedule.
To create a Cron task, subclass `CronTask` class and overwrite it's `execute` method exactly
as you would any other regular task.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import ExecutionContext
from tilebox.workflows.recurrent_tasks import CronTask

class MyCronTask(CronTask):
    message: str

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        print(f"Hello {self.message} from a Cron Task!")
        # self.trigger is an attribute of the CronTask class,
        # which contains information about the trigger event
        # that caused this task to be submitted as part of a job
        print(f"This task was triggered at {self.trigger.time}")
```

## Registering a Cron Trigger

Once a Cron task is implemented, it can be registered to be triggered on a Cron schedule.
This means, every minute for which the Cron expression matches, a new job gets be submitted, consisting of
a single task instance derived from the Cron registered task prototype.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
recurrent_tasks = client.recurrent_tasks()
cron_task = recurrent_tasks.create_recurring_cron_task(
    "my-cron-task",  # name of the recurring cron task
    "dev-cluster",  # cluster slug to submit jobs to
    MyCronTask(message="World"),  # the task (and its input parameters) to run repeatedly
    cron_triggers=[
        "12 * * * *",  # run every hour at minute 12
        "45 18 * * *",  # run every day at 18:45
        "30 13 * * 3",  # run every Wednesday at 13:30
    ],
)
```

<Tip>
    The syntax for specifying the cron triggers is a [CRON expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).
    A helpful tool to test your cron expressions is [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/).
</Tip>

## Start a Task Runner capable of executing Cron Tasks

With the Cron task registered, a job gets submitted whenever the Cron expression matches. But for the tasks to actually
run, a [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) needs to be available capable of executing the Cron task.
If no task runner is available, the submitted jobs remain in a task queue. Once a 
[eligible task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners#task-selection) becomes available, all jobs in the 
queue are picked up and executed.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyCronTask])
runner.run_forever()
```

Leaving this task runner running, after a while it's output looks like this:

```plaintext Output
Hello World from a Cron Task!
This task was triggered at 2023-09-25 16:12:00
Hello World from a Cron Task!
This task was triggered at 2023-09-25 17:12:00
Hello World from a Cron Task!
This task was triggered at 2023-09-25 18:12:00
Hello World from a Cron Task!
This task was triggered at 2023-09-25 18:45:00
Hello World from a Cron Task!
This task was triggered at 2023-09-25 19:12:00
```

## Inspecting the registered Cron Task

The [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com/workflows/recurrent-tasks) offers a convenient way to inspect all
the recurrent tasks that are registered to run on a schedule.

Once you've registered a cron task, you can inspect it in the console. Here is an example of what it looks like:

<Frame>
  <img src="/assets/workflows/recurrent-tasks/cron-light.png" alt="Tilebox Workflows recurrent tasks in the Tilebox Console" className="dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/assets/workflows/recurrent-tasks/cron-dark.png" alt="Tilebox Workflows recurrent tasks in the Tilebox Console" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

You can use the console to view, edit, and delete the cron tasks that are registered.

## Deleting Cron Triggers

To delete a registered cron task, use `recurrent_tasks.delete`. After deletion, no new jobs get submitted by
a cron trigger. But jobs submitted in the past, which are still in the queue, remain in the queue and can still be
picked up by a task runner.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
recurrent_tasks = client.recurrent_tasks()

# delete the task as returned by create_recurring_cron_task
recurrent_tasks.delete(cron_task)

# or manually by id:
recurrent_tasks.delete("0190bafc-b3b8-88c4-008b-a5db044380d0")
```

## Submitting Cron jobs manually

To test cron tasks, they can be submitted as regular tasks. This is useful for testing purposes, or if you
want to submit a cron task as part of a larger workflow. To do so, it needs to be instantiated with a specific trigger
time using the `once` method.

<Note>
    Submitting a job with a cron task once immediately schedules the task, and a runner could pick
    it up and execute it immediately. The given time specified in the `once` method does not influence the time at which
    the task gets executed, only the `self.trigger.time` attribute of the cron task corresponds to the specified time.
</Note>

```python Python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

job_client = client.jobs()

# create a Cron task prototype
task = MyCronTask(message="Hello")

# submitting it directly won't work: raises ValueError:
# CronTask cannot be submitted without being triggered. Use task.once().
job_client.submit("my-testing-cron-job", task, cluster="dev-cluster")

# we need to specify a trigger time, so we can submit the task as a regular task
triggered_task = task.once()  # same as task.once(datetime.now())
job_client.submit("my-testing-cron-job", triggered_task, cluster="dev-cluster")

# or we can simulate a trigger at a specific time
triggered_task = task.once(datetime(2030, 12, 12, 15, 15, tzinfo=timezone.utc))
# the task will be scheduled to run immediately, even with a future trigger time
# but self.trigger.time will be 2023-12-12T15:15:00Z for the task instance
job_client.submit("my-testing-cron-job", triggered_task, cluster="dev-cluster")
```
