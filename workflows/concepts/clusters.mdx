<Accordion title="What is a Cluster?">
  Clusters are a way of grouping [task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) together. This is useful when you have a large
  number of task runners and you want to manage them as a group. For example, you might have a cluster defined for task
  runners that are running on a particular cloud provider, or a cluster for task runners that share similar hardware.
</Accordion>

## Use Cases

You might want to organize task runners into clusters for many reasons, such as:

- Targeting a specific group of task runners for a particular job
- Reserving a group of task runners for specific purpose, such as only running a particular kind of batch processing jobs
- Set up different clusters for different environments (for example development, production)

Even Task runners belonging to the same cluster may have different capabilities, for example different tasks registered that they can run.
Distributing tasks to different runners can also be achieved using only a single cluster, see the
[Distributed Execution](/workflows/concepts/task-runners#distributed-execution) example for more details.

If you have different task runners that all have the same tasks registered, you then can use clusters to only target
specific task runners for a particular job.

### Adding Task Runners to a Cluster

Task runners can be added to a cluster by specifying the [clusters' slug](#cluster-slug) when [registering a task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners).

## Managing Clusters

Before registering a task runner, or submitting a job, you need to create a cluster. You can also list, fetch, and delete
clusters as needed. The following sections illustrates how to do this.

To manage clusters, you first need to instantiate a cluster client. You can do this by calling the `clusters` method on the
workflows' client.

<CodeGroup title="Instantiating a Clusters Client">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.workflows import Client

    client = Client()
    clusters = client.clusters()
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.workflows.aio import Client

    client = Client()
    clusters = await client.clusters()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### Creating a Cluster

To create a cluster, call the `create` method on the cluster client. You'll need to provide a name for the cluster.

<CodeGroup title="Creating a Cluster">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    cluster = clusters.create("testing")
    print(cluster)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    cluster = await clusters.create("testing")
    print(cluster)
    ```

</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
Cluster(slug='testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe', display_name='testing')
```

### Cluster Slug

Each cluster is identified by a unique name, consisting of the cluster's name and a unique identifier. This identifier is
generated automatically when the cluster is created. You can use this slug to reference the cluster in other operations,
such as submitting a job or subtasks.

### Listing Clusters

To list all the clusters that are available to you, you can use `all`:

<CodeGroup title="Listing Clusters">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    all_clusters = clusters.all()
    print(all_clusters)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    all_clusters = await clusters.all()
    print(all_clusters)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
[Cluster(slug='testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe', display_name='testing'),
Cluster(slug='production-EifhUozDpwAJDL', display_name='Production')]
```

### Fetching a specific Cluster

To fetch a specific cluster, you can use the `fetch` method and pass in a cluster's slug:

<CodeGroup title="Fetching a Cluster">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    cluster = clusters.find("testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe")
    print(cluster)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    cluster = await clusters.find("testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe")
    print(cluster)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
Cluster(slug='testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe', display_name='testing')
```

### Deleting a Cluster

To delete a cluster, you can use the `delete` method and pass in a cluster's slug:

<CodeGroup title="Deleting a Cluster">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    clusters.delete("testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe")
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    await clusters.delete("testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Jobs spanning different clusters

[When submitting a job](/workflows/concepts/jobs) you need to specify the cluster that the job should be submitted to.
This allows you to target a specific group of task runners for a particular job. All sub-tasks within the job are
submitted to the same cluster by default. This can also be manually overridden to submit sub-tasks to other
clusters if needed. Check out the example below to see how this can be done.

<CodeGroup title="Deleting a Cluster">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext, Client

    class MultiClusterWorkflow(Task):
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            # this will submit a task to the same cluster as the one currently executing this task
            same_cluster = context.submit_subtask(DummyTask())
            #
            other_cluster = context.submit_subtask(
                DummyTask(),
                # this task should only run on a task runner in the "other-cluster" cluster
                cluster="other-cluster-As3dcSb3D9SAdK",
                # dependencies can also be specified across clusters
                depends_on=[same_cluster],
            )

    class DummyTask(Task):
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass

    # submit a job to the "testing" cluster
    client = Client()
    job_client = client.jobs()
    job = job_client.submit(
        MultiClusterWorkflow(),
        cluster="testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe",
    )
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.workflows.aio import Task, ExecutionContext, Client

    class MultiClusterWorkflow(Task):
        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            # this will submit a task to the same cluster as the one currently executing this task
            same_cluster = context.submit_subtask(DummyTask())

            other_cluster = context.submit_subtask(
                DummyTask(),
                # this task should only run on a task runner in the "other-cluster" cluster
                cluster="other-cluster-As3dcSb3D9SAdK",
                # dependencies can also be specified across clusters
                depends_on=[same_cluster],
            )

    class DummyTask(Task):
        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            pass

    # submit a job to the "testing" cluster
    client = Client()
    job_client = await client.jobs()
    job = await job_client.submit(
        MultiClusterWorkflow(),
        cluster="testing-CvufcSxcC9SKfe",
    )
    ```

</CodeGroup>

This workflow requires at least two task runners to complete. One task runner must be in the "testing" cluster
and the other must be in the "other-cluster" cluster. If for example no task runners are available in the "other-cluster"
cluster, the task submitted to that cluster remains in the queue until a task runner becomes available. It won't
be executed by a task runner in the "testing" cluster, even though the task runner would have the capability to execute it,
since it has the `DummyTask` registered.
