<Accordion title="What is a Task?">
    A Task is the smallest unit of work, designed to perform a specific operation. Each task represents a distinct operation or process that can be executed, such as processing data, performing calculations, or managing resources. Tasks can operate independently or as components of a more complex set of connected tasks known as a Workflow. Tasks are defined by their code, inputs, and dependencies on other tasks. To create tasks, you need to define the input parameters and specify the action to be performed during execution.
</Accordion>

## Creating a Task

To create a task in Tilebox, define a class that extends the `Task` base class and implements the `execute` method. The `execute` method is the entry point for the task where its logic is defined. It's called when the task is executed.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

class MyFirstTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
        print("Hello World!")
```
```go Go
type MyFirstTask struct{}

func (t *MyFirstTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	slog.Info("Hello World!")
	return nil
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This example demonstrates a simple task that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

For python, the key components of this task are:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="class MyFirstTask(Task)">
    `MyFirstTask` is a subclass of the `Task` class, which serves as the base class for all defined tasks. It provides the essential structure for a task. Inheriting from `Task` automatically makes the class a `dataclass`, which is useful [for specifying inputs](#input-parameters). Additionally, by inheriting from `Task`, the task is automatically assigned an [identifier based on the class name](#task-identifiers).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="def execute">
    The `execute` method is the entry point for executing the task. This is where the task's logic is defined. It's invoked by a [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) when the task runs and performs the task's operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="context: ExecutionContext">
    The `context` argument is an `ExecutionContext` instance that provides access to an [API for submitting new tasks](/api-reference/python/tilebox.workflows/ExecutionContext.submit_subtask) as part of the same job and features like [shared caching](/api-reference/python/tilebox.workflows/ExecutionContext.job_cache).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For Go, the key components are:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="type MyFirstTask struct{}">
    `MyFirstTask` is a struct that implements the `Task` interface. It represents the task to be executed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="func (t *MyFirstTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error">
    The `Execute` method is the entry point for executing the task. This is where the task's logic is defined. It's invoked by a [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) when the task runs and performs the task's operation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The code samples on this page do not illustrate how to execute the task. That will be covered in the 
  [next section on task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners). The reason for that is that executing tasks is a separate concern from implementing tasks.
</Note>

## Input Parameters

Tasks often require input parameters to operate. These inputs can range from simple values to complex data structures. By inheriting from the `Task` class, the task is treated as a Python `dataclass`, allowing input parameters to be defined as class attributes.

<Info>
  Tasks must be **serializable to JSON or to protobuf** because they may be distributed across a cluster of [task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners).
</Info>

<Info>
  In Go, task parameters must be exported fields of the task struct (starting with an uppercase letter), otherwise they will not be serialized to JSON.
</Info>

Supported types for input parameters include:

- Basic types such as `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- Lists and dictionaries of basic types
- Nested data classes that are also JSON-serializable or protobuf-serializable

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    class ParametrizableTask(Task):
        message: str
        number: int
        data: dict[str, str]

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
            print(self.message * self.number)

    task = ParametrizableTask("Hello", 3, {"key": "value"})
    ```
    ```go Go
    type ParametrizableTask struct {
      Message string
      Number  int
      Data    map[string]string
    }

    func (t *ParametrizableTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
      slog.Info(strings.Repeat(t.Message, t.Number))
      return nil
    }

    task := &ParametrizableTask{
      message: "Hello",
      number:  3,
      data:    map[string]string{"key": "value"},
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Task Composition and subtasks

Until now, tasks have performed only a single operation. But tasks can be more powerful. **Tasks can submit other tasks as subtasks.** This allows for a modular workflow design, breaking down complex operations into simpler, manageable parts. Additionally, the execution of subtasks is automatically parallelized whenever possible.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
class ParentTask(Task):
    num_subtasks: int

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        for i in range(self.num_subtasks):
            context.submit_subtask(ChildTask(i))

class ChildTask(Task):
    index: int

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        print(f"Executing ChildTask {self.index}")

# after submitting this task, a task runner may pick it up and execute it
# which will result in 5 ChildTasks being submitted and executed as well
task = ParentTask(5)
```
```go Go
type ParentTask struct {
	NumSubtasks int
}

func (t *ParentTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	for i := range t.NumSubtasks {
		_, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &ChildTask{Index: i})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}

	return nil
}

type ChildTask struct {
	Index int
}

func (t *ChildTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
	slog.Info("Executing ChildTask", slog.Int("index", t.Index))
	
	return nil
}

// after submitting this task, a task runner may pick it up and execute it 
// which will result in 5 ChildTasks being submitted and executed as well
task := &ParentTask{numSubtasks: 5}
```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, a `ParentTask` submits `ChildTask` tasks as subtasks. The number of subtasks to be submitted is based on the `num_subtasks` attribute of the `ParentTask`. The `submit_subtask` method takes an instance of a task as its argument, meaning the task to be submitted must be instantiated with concrete parameters first.

Parent task do not have access to results of subtasks, instead, tasks can use [shared caching](/workflows/caches#storing-and-retrieving-data) to share data between tasks.

<Info>
  By submitting a task as a subtask, its execution is scheduled as part of the same job as the parent task. Compared to just directly invoking the subtask's `execute` method, this allows the subtask's execution to occur on a different machine or in parallel with other subtasks. To learn more about how tasks are executed, see the section on [task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners).
</Info>

### Larger subtasks example

A practical workflow example showcasing task composition might help illustrate the capabilities of tasks. Below is an example of a set of tasks forming a workflow capable of downloading a set number of random dog images from the internet. The [Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) can be used to get the image URLs, and then download them. Implementing this using Task Composition could look like this:

<CodeGroup title="Task Composition">
```python Python
import httpx  # pip install httpx
from pathlib import Path

class DownloadRandomDogImages(Task):
    num_images: int

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        url = f"https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?limit={self.num_images}"
        response = httpx.get(url)
        for dog_image in response.json():
            context.submit_subtask(DownloadImage(dog_image["url"]))

class DownloadImage(Task):
    url: str

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        file = Path("dogs") / self.url.split("/")[-1]
        response = httpx.get(self.url)
        with file.open("wb") as file:
            file.write(response.content)
```
```go Go
package dogs

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/workflows/v1"
)

type DogImage struct {
	ID     string `json:"id"`
	URL    string `json:"url"`
	Width  *int   `json:"width"`
	Height *int   `json:"height"`
}

type DownloadRandomDogImages struct {
	NumImages int
}

func (t *DownloadRandomDogImages) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	url := fmt.Sprintf("https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=%d", t.NumImages)
	response, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to download images: %w", err)
	}

	defer response.Body.Close()
	body, err := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to read response: %w", err)
	}

	var dogImages []DogImage
	err = json.Unmarshal(body, &dogImages)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	for _, dogImage := range dogImages {
		_, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &DownloadImage{URL: dogImage.URL})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
	return nil
}

type DownloadImage struct {
	URL string
}

func (t *DownloadImage) Execute(context.Context) error {
	response, err := http.Get(t.URL)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to download image: %w", err)
	}

	defer response.Body.Close()
	body, err := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to read response: %w", err)
	}

	err = os.MkdirAll("dogs", 0o755)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to create dogs directory: %w", err)
	}

	elements := strings.Split(t.URL, "/")
	file := fmt.Sprintf("dogs/%s", elements[len(elements)-1])

	return os.WriteFile(file, body, 0o600)
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This example consists of the following tasks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DownloadRandomDogImages">
    `DownloadRandomDogImages` fetches a specific number of random dog image URLs from an API. It then submits a `DownloadImage` task for each received image URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DownloadImage">
    `DownloadImage` downloads an image from a specified URL and saves it to a file.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Together, these tasks create a workflow that downloads random dog images from the internet. The relationship between the two tasks and their formation as a workflow becomes clear when `DownloadRandomDogImages` submits `DownloadImage` tasks as subtasks.

Visualizing the execution of such a workflow is akin to a tree structure where the `DownloadRandomDogImages` task is the root, and the `DownloadImage` tasks are the leaves. For instance, when downloading five random dog images, the following tasks are executed.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
jobs = client.jobs()
job = jobs.submit(
    "download-dog-images",
    DownloadRandomDogImages(5),
)

# now our deployed task runners will pick up the task and execute it

jobs.display(job)
```
```go Go
ctx := context.Background()
client := workflows.NewClient()

job, err := client.Jobs.Submit(ctx, "download-dog-images",
  []workflows.Task{
	&helloworld.DownloadRandomDogImages{
		NumImages: 5,
	},
  },
)
if err != nil {
  slog.Error("Failed to submit job", slog.Any("error", err))
  return
}

// now our deployed task runners will pick up the task and execute it
```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/download-dog-images.svg"
    alt="Download Dog Images Workflow"
    className="dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/download-dog-images.dark.svg"
    alt="Download Dog Images Workflow"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

In total, six tasks are executed: the `DownloadRandomDogImages` task and five `DownloadImage` tasks. The `DownloadImage` tasks can execute in parallel, as they are independent. If more than one task runner is available, the Tilebox Workflow Orchestrator **automatically parallelizes** the execution of these tasks.

<Tip>
  Check out [job_client.display](/workflows/concepts/jobs#visualization) to learn how this visualization was automatically generated from the task executions.
</Tip>

Currently, a limit of `64` subtasks per task is in place to discourage creating workflows where individual parent tasks submit a large number of subtasks, which can lead to performance issues since those parent tasks are not parallelized. If you need to submit more than `64` subtasks, consider using [recursive subtask submission](#recursive-subtasks) instead.

## Recursive subtasks

Tasks can submit other tasks as subtasks, allowing for complex workflows. Sometimes the input to a task is a list, with elements that can be **mapped** to individual subtasks, whose outputs are then aggregated in a **reduce** step. This pattern is commonly known as **MapReduce**.

Often times the initial map step—submitting the individual subtasks—might already be an expensive operation. Since this is executed within a single task, it's not parallelizable, which can bottleneck the entire workflow.

Fortunately, Tilebox Workflows offers a solution through **recursive subtask submission**. A task can submit instances of itself as subtasks, enabling a recursive breakdown into smaller tasks.

For example, the `RecursiveTask` below is a valid task that submits smaller instances of itself as subtasks.

<CodeGroup title="Recursive Subtasks">
    ```python Python
    class RecursiveTask(Task):
        num: int

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            print(f"Executing RecursiveTask with num={self.num}")
            if self.num >= 2:
                context.submit_subtask(RecursiveTask(self.num // 2))
    ```
    ```go Go
    type RecursiveTask struct {
      Num int
    }

    func (t *RecursiveTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
      slog.Info("Executing RecursiveTask", slog.Int("num", t.Num))
      if t.Num >= 2 {
        _, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &RecursiveTask{Num: t.Num / 2})
        if err != nil {
          return err
        }
      }
      return nil
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Recursive subtask example

An example for this is the [random dog images workflow](#larger-subtasks-example) mentioned earlier. In the previous implementation, downloading images was already parallelized. But the initial orchestration of the individual download tasks was not parallelized, because `DownloadRandomDogImages` was responsible for fetching all random dog image URLs and only submitted the individual download tasks once all URLs were retrieved. For a large number of images this setup can bottleneck the entire workflow.

To improve this, recursive subtask submission decomposes a `DownloadRandomDogImages` task with a high number of images into two smaller `DownloadRandomDogImages` tasks, each fetching half. This process can be repeated until a specified threshold is met, at which point the Dog API can be queried directly for image URLs. That way, image downloads start as soon as the first URLs are retrieved, without initial waiting.

An implementation of this recursive submission may look like this:

<CodeGroup title="Task Composition">
```python Python
class DownloadRandomDogImages(Task):
    num_images: int

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        if self.num_images > 4:
            half = self.num_images // 2
            remaining = self.num_images - half  # account for odd numbers
            context.submit_subtask(DownloadRandomDogImages(half))
            context.submit_subtask(DownloadRandomDogImages(remaining))
        else:
            url = f"https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?limit={self.num_images}"
            response = httpx.get(url)
            for dog_image in response.json()[:self.num_images]:
                context.submit_subtask(DownloadImage(dog_image["url"]))
```
```go Go
type DownloadRandomDogImages struct {
	NumImages int
}

func (t *DownloadRandomDogImages) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	if t.NumImages > 4 {
		half := t.NumImages / 2
		remaining := t.NumImages - half // account for odd numbers
		_, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &DownloadRandomDogImages{NumImages: half})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		_, err = workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &DownloadRandomDogImages{NumImages: remaining})
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	} else {
		url := fmt.Sprintf("https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=%d", t.NumImages)
		response, err := http.Get(url)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to download images: %w", err)
		}

		defer response.Body.Close()
		body, err := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to read response: %w", err)
		}

		var dogImages []DogImage
		err = json.Unmarshal(body, &dogImages)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		for _, dogImage := range dogImages {
			_, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &DownloadImage{URL: dogImage.URL})
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```
</CodeGroup>

With this implementation, downloading a large number of images (for example, 9) results in the following tasks being executed:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/download-dog-images-recursive.svg"
    alt="Download Dog Images Workflow implemented recursively"
    className="dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/download-dog-images-recursive.dark.svg"
    alt="Download Dog Images Workflow implemented recursively"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

## Retry Handling

By default, when a task fails to execute, it's marked as failed. In some cases, it may be useful to retry the task multiple times before marking it as a failure. This is particularly useful for tasks dependent on external services that might be temporarily unavailable.

Tilebox Workflows allows you to specify the number of retries for a task using the `max_retries` argument of the `submit_subtask` method.

Check out the example below to see how this might look like in practice.

<Note>
  A failed task may be picked up by any available runner and not necessarily the same one that it failed on.
</Note>

<CodeGroup title="Submitting Subtasks">
```python Python
import random

class RootTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        context.submit_subtask(FlakyTask(), max_retries=5)

class FlakyTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        print(f"Executing FlakyTask")

        if random.random() < 0.1:
            raise Exception("FlakyTask failed randomly")
```
```go Go
package flaky

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"log/slog"
	"math/rand/v2"

	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/workflows/v1"
	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/workflows/v1/subtask"
)

type RootTask struct{}

func (t *RootTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	_, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(ctx, &FlakyTask{},
		subtask.WithMaxRetries(5),
	)
	return err
}

type FlakyTask struct{}

func (t *FlakyTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
	slog.Info("Executing FlakyTask")

	if rand.Float64() < 0.1 {
		return errors.New("FlakyTask failed randomly")
	}
	return nil
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Dependencies

Tasks often rely on other tasks. For example, a task that processes data might depend on a task that fetches that data. **Tasks can express their dependencies on other tasks** by using the `depends_on` argument of the [`submit_subtask`](/api-reference/python/tilebox.workflows/ExecutionContext.submit_subtask) method. This means that a dependent task will only execute after the task it relies on has successfully completed.

<Note>
  The `depends_on` argument accepts a list of tasks, enabling a task to depend on multiple other tasks.
</Note>

A workflow with dependencies might look like this:

<CodeGroup title="Task Composition">
```python Python
class RootTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        first_task = context.submit_subtask(
          PrintTask("Executing first")
        )
        second_task = context.submit_subtask(
          PrintTask("Executing second"), 
          depends_on=[first_task],
        )
        third_task = context.submit_subtask(
          PrintTask("Executing last"),
          depends_on=[second_task],
        )

class PrintTask(Task):
    message: str

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        print(self.message)
```
```go Go
type RootTask struct{}

func (t *RootTask) Execute(ctx context.Context) error {
	firstTask, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(
		ctx,
		&PrintTask{Message: "Executing first"},
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	secondTask, err := workflows.SubmitSubtask(
		ctx,
		&PrintTask{Message: "Executing second"},
		subtask.WithDependencies(firstTask),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	_, err = workflows.SubmitSubtask(
		ctx,
		&PrintTask{Message: "Executing last"},
		subtask.WithDependencies(secondTask),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}

type PrintTask struct {
	Message string
}

func (t *PrintTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
	slog.Info("PrintTask", slog.String("message", t.Message))
	return nil
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The `RootTask` submits three `PrintTask` tasks as subtasks. These tasks depend on each other, meaning the second task executes only after the first task has successfully completed, and the third only executes after the second completes. The tasks are executed sequentially.

<Note>
  If a task upon which another task depends submits subtasks, those subtasks must also execute before the dependent task begins execution.
</Note>

### Dependencies Example

A practical example is a workflow that fetches news articles from an API and processes them using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

<CodeGroup title="Task Dependencies">
    ```python Python
    from pathlib import Path
    import json
    from collections import Counter

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            fetch_task = context.submit_subtask(FetchNews(self.category, self.max_articles))
            context.submit_subtask(PrintHeadlines(), depends_on=[fetch_task])
            context.submit_subtask(MostFrequentAuthors(), depends_on=[fetch_task])

    class FetchNews(Task):
        category: str
        max_articles: int

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            url = f"https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?category={self.category}&pageSize={self.max_articles}&country=us&apiKey=API_KEY"

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            news = json.loads(Path("news.json").read_text())
            for article in news["articles"]:
                print(f"{article['publishedAt'][:10]}: {article['title']}")

    class MostFrequentAuthors(Task):
        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            news = json.loads(Path("news.json").read_text())
            authors = [article["author"] for article in news["articles"]]
            for author, count in Counter(authors).most_common():
                print(f"Author {author} has written {count} articles")

    # now submit a job, and then visualize it
    job = job_client.submit("process-news",
        NewsWorkflow(category="science", max_articles=5),
    )
    ```

This workflow consists of four tasks:

| Task                | Dependencies | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NewsWorkflow        | -            | The root task of the workflow. It spawns the other tasks and sets up the dependencies between them.                       |
| FetchNews           | -            | A task that fetches news articles from the API and writes the results to a file, which is then read by dependent tasks.    |
| PrintHeadlines      | FetchNews    | A task that prints the headlines of the news articles to the console.                                                      |
| MostFrequentAuthors | FetchNews    | A task that counts the number of articles each author has written and prints the result to the console.                    |

An important aspect is that there is no dependency between the `PrintHeadlines` and `MostFrequentAuthors` tasks. This means they can execute in parallel, which the Tilebox Workflow Orchestrator will do, provided multiple task runners are available.

<Tip>
  In this example, the results from `FetchNews` are stored in a file. This is not the recommended method for passing data between tasks. When executing on a distributed cluster, the existence of a file written by a dependent task cannot be guaranteed. Instead, it's better to use a [shared cache](/workflows/caches).
</Tip>

## Task Identifiers

A task identifier is a unique string used by the Tilebox Workflow Orchestrator to identify the task. It's used by [task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) to map submitted tasks to a task class and execute them. It also serves as the default name in execution visualizations as a tree of tasks.

If unspecified, the identifier of a task defaults to the class name. For instance, the identifier of the `PrintHeadlines` task in the previous example is `"PrintHeadlines"`. This is good for prototyping, but not recommended for production, as changing the class name also changes the identifier, which can lead to issues during refactoring. It also prevents different tasks from sharing the same class name.

To address this, Tilebox Workflows offers a way to explicitly specify the identifier of a task. This is done by overriding the `identifier` method of the `Task` class. This method should return a unique string identifying the task. This decouples the task's identifier from its class name, allowing you to change the identifier without renaming the class. It also allows tasks with the same class name to have different identifiers. The `identifier` method can also specify a version number for the task—see the section on [semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning) below for more details.

<CodeGroup title="Overriding the Task Identifier">
```python Python
class MyTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        pass

# MyTask has the identifier "MyTask" and the default version of "v0.0"

class MyTask2(Task):
    @staticmethod
    def identifier() -> tuple[str, str]:
        return "tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask", "v1.0"

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        pass

# MyTask2 has the identifier "tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask" and the version "v1.0"
```
```go Go
type MyTask struct{}

func (t *MyTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
	return nil
}

// MyTask has the identifier "MyTask" and the default version of "v0.0"

type MyTask2 struct{}

func (t *MyTask2) Identifier() workflows.TaskIdentifier {
	return workflows.NewTaskIdentifier("tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask", "v1.0")
}

func (t *MyTask2) Execute(context.Context) error {
	return nil
}

// MyTask2 has the identifier "tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask" and the version "v1.0"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  In python, the `identifier` method must be defined as either a `classmethod` or a `staticmethod`, meaning it can be called without instantiating the class.
</Note>

## Semantic Versioning

As seen in the previous section, the `identifier` method can return a tuple of two strings, where the first string is the identifier and the second string is the version number. This allows for semantic versioning of tasks.

Versioning is important for managing changes to a task's execution method. It allows for new features, bug fixes, and changes while ensuring existing workflows operate as expected. Additionally, it enables multiple versions of a task to coexist, enabling gradual rollout of changes without interrupting production deployments.

You assign a version number by overriding the `identifier` method of the task class. It must return a tuple of two strings: the first is the [identifier](#task-identifiers) and the second is the version number, which must match the pattern `vX.Y` (where `X` and `Y` are non-negative integers). `X` is the major version number and `Y` is the minor version.

For example, this task has the identifier `"tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask"` and the version `"v1.3"`:

<CodeGroup title="Overriding the Task Identifier">
```python Python
class MyTask(Task):
    @staticmethod
    def identifier() -> tuple[str, str]:
        return "tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask", "v1.3"

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        pass
```
```go Go
type MyTask struct{}

func (t *MyTask) Identifier() workflows.TaskIdentifier {
	return workflows.NewTaskIdentifier("tilebox.com/example_workflow/MyTask", "v1.3")
}

func (t *MyTask) Execute(context.Context) error {
	return nil
}
```
</CodeGroup>

When a task is submitted as part of a job, the version from which it's submitted is recorded and may differ from the version on the task runner executing the task.

When task runners execute a task, they require a registered task with a matching identifier and compatible version number. A compatible version is where the major version number on the task runner matches that of the submitted task, and the minor version number on the task runner is equal to or greater than that of the submitted task.

Examples of compatible version numbers include:

- `MyTask` is submitted as part of a job. The version is `"v1.3"`.
- A task runner with version `"v1.3"` of `MyTask` would executes this task.
- A task runner with version `"v1.5"` of `MyTask` would also executes this task.
- A task runner with version `"v1.2"` of `MyTask` would not execute this task, as its minor version is lower than that of the submitted task.
- A task runner with version `"v2.5"` of `MyTask` would not execute this task, as its major version differs from that of the submitted task.

## States

A task can be in one of the following states:

- `QUEUED`: the task is queued and waiting to be run
- `RUNNING`: the task is currently running on some task runner
- `COMPUTED`: the task has been computed and the output is available. Once in this state, the task will never transition to any other state
- `FAILED`: the task has failed
- `CANCELLED`: the task has been cancelled due to user request

## Conclusion

Tasks form the foundation of Tilebox Workflows. By understanding how to create and manage tasks, you can leverage Tilebox's capabilities to automate and optimize your workflows. Experiment with defining your own tasks, utilizing subtasks, managing dependencies, and employing semantic versioning to develop robust and efficient workflows.
