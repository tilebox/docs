<Accordion title="What is a Job?">
A job is a concrete execution of a workflow with specific input parameters. A job consists of one or more tasks which may run in
parallel or in sequence, depending on their dependencies.
Submitting a job involves instantiating a root task with concrete input parameters which then may trigger the execution of
other tasks of the same workflow in the same job.
</Accordion>

## Submission

In order for a [task](/workflows/concepts/tasks) to be executed, it must be instantiated with concrete inputs and then submitted
as a job. The task is then be executed in the context of the job, and if it spawns sub-tasks, they are executed as
part of the same job as well.

Once a job is submitted, its root task is scheduled for execution, and any [eligible task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners#task-selection)
may pick it up and execute it.

For submitting a job, a job client needs to be instantiated first. This can be done by calling the `jobs` method on the
[workflows' client](/workflows/creating).

<CodeGroup>
```python Python (Sync)
from tilebox.workflows import Client

client = Client()
job_client = client.jobs()
```
```python Python (Async)
from tilebox.workflows.aio import Client

client = Client()
job_client = await client.jobs()
```
</CodeGroup>

Once you have a job client, you can submit a job by calling the `submit` method on it. This requires a name for the job, 
an instance of the root [task](/workflows/concepts/tasks), and a [cluster](/workflows/concepts/clusters)
to submit the job to.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    # import your own workflow
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    cluster = "dev-cluster"
    job = job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask("some", "parameters"), cluster)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    # import your own workflow
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    cluster = "dev-cluster"
    job = await job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask("some", "parameters"), cluster)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Now that a job has been submitted, it's immediately scheduled for execution. As soon as a [eligible task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners#task-selection)
is available, the root task of the job is picked up and executed.

## Retry Handling

[Tasks support retry handling](/workflows/concepts/tasks#retry-handling) when their execution fails. This also applies to
the root task of a job, where the number of retries can be specified by using the `max_retries` argument of the `submit` method.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    from my_workflow import MyFlakyTask

    cluster = "dev-cluster"
    job = job_client.submit('my-job', MyFlakyTask(), cluster, max_retries=5)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from my_workflow import MyFlakyTask

    cluster = "dev-cluster"
    job = await job_client.submit('my-job', MyFlakyTask(), cluster, max_retries=5)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, if `MyFlakyTask` fails, it gets retried up to 5 times before being eventually marked as failed.

## Fetching a specific Job by ID

When a job is submitted, it gets assigned a unique identifier. This identifier can be used to retrieve the job at any time.

To retrieve a job by its identifier, the `find` method on the job client can be used.

<CodeGroup title="Retrieving a Job by ID">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    job = job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask("some", "parameters"), cluster)
    print(job.id)  # 018dd029-58ca-74e5-8b58-b4f99d610f9a

    # later on, or in another process or on a completely different machine, job info can be retrieved
    job = job_client.find("018dd029-58ca-74e5-8b58-b4f99d610f9a")
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    job = await job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask("some", "parameters"), cluster)
    print(job.id)  # 018dd029-58ca-74e5-8b58-b4f99d610f9a

    # later on, or in another process or on a completely different machine, job info can be retrieved
    job = await job_client.find("018dd029-58ca-74e5-8b58-b4f99d610f9a")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Visualization

Sometimes it's useful to visualize the execution of a job.
Since the workflow orchestrator keeps track of the execution of all tasks in a job, including [sub-tasks](/workflows/concepts/tasks#subtasks-and-task-composition)
and [dependencies](/workflows/concepts/tasks#dependencies), it's possible to visualize the execution of a job as a graph diagram.

Assuming you have submitted a job, you can use the `display` method on the job client to display the execution of the job as a graph diagram.

<Note>
    The `display` method is designed to be used in an [interactive environment](/sdks/python/jupyter), such as a Jupyter notebook.
    In non-interactive environments, use `job_client.visualize` instead which returns the rendered diagram as a string
    in the SVG format.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    job = job_client.find("some-job-id")  # or a job that was just submitted
    # and then visualize it
    job_client.display(job)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    job = await job_client.find("some-job-id")  # or a job that was just submitted
    # and then visualize it
    await job_client.display(job)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

The following diagram displays the execution of a job as a graph. Each task is represented as a node in the graph,
and the edges between nodes represent a sub-task relationship. The diagram also shows the status of each task,
by using a color code.

<Frame>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/task-states.svg" alt="Color coding of task states" className="dark:hidden"/>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/task-states.dark.svg" alt="Color coding of task states" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

The color codes used to represent the state of a task are:

| Task State | Color | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Queued     | <span className="dark:hidden">Salmon</span><span className="hidden dark:block">Yellow</span>  | The task is queued and waiting for a task runner to pick it up. |
| Running    | Blue | The task is currently being executed by a task runner. |
| Succeeded  | Green | The task has successfully finished executing. |
| Failed     | Red | The task has been executed, but resulted in an error. |

Below is a visualization of another job that is currently being executed
by some task runners.

<Frame>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/multiple-runners.svg" alt="Job that is currently being executed by some runners" className="dark:hidden"/>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/multiple-runners.dark.svg" alt="Job that is currently being executed by some runners" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

From this visualization, the following observations can be made:

- The root task of the job, `MyTask`, was already executed and spawned three sub-tasks.
- At least three task runners available, since currently three tasks are being executed at the same time.
- The `SubTask` that is currently still being executed didn't spawn any sub-tasks yet. That is because submitted sub-tasks
    are only queued for execution after the task that spawned them has itself finished executing.
- The `DependentTask` that is still queued is waiting for the completion of the `LeafTask` before it can be executed.

<Note>
    Visualization of a job is intended to be used as help for development and debugging purposes. It's not
    intended to be used for large jobs with hundreds or thousands of tasks, as the diagram may become too complex to
    be useful or readable. That's why currently, the visualization is limited to jobs with a max of 200 tasks.
</Note>

### Customizing Task Display Names

The text representing a task in the diagram defaults to the class name of the task. If you want to customize this text, you can do so by
changing the `display` field of the `current_task` object in the execution context of a task execution. The max length of
the display name is 1024 characters. Any string larger than that is truncated. The display name may optionally contain
line breaks.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

    class RootTask(Task):
        num_subtasks: int

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
            context.current_task.display = f"Root({self.num_subtasks})"
            for i in range(self.num_subtasks):
                context.submit_subtask(SubTask(i))

    class SubTask(Task):
        index: int

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
            context.current_task.display = f"Leaf Nr. {self.index}"

    job = job_client.submit('custom-display-names', RootTask(3), "dev-cluster")
    job_client.display(job)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    from tilebox.workflows.aio import Task, ExecutionContext

    class RootTask(Task):
        num_subtasks: int

        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
            context.current_task.display = f"Root({self.num_subtasks})"
            for i in range(self.num_subtasks):
                context.submit_subtask(SubTask(i))

    class SubTask(Task):
        index: int

        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext):
            context.current_task.display = f"Leaf Nr. {self.index}"

    job = await job_client.submit('custom-display-names', RootTask(3), "dev-cluster")
    await job_client.display(job)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/custom-display-names.svg" alt="Customize Tasks Display Names" className="dark:hidden"/>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/custom-display-names.dark.svg" alt="Customize Tasks Display Names" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

## Cancellation

A job can be canceled at any time. When a job is canceled, all tasks of the job that are queued are removed from the
queue. Even if there are idle task runners available, they the tasks of a canceled job are not being executed.
But if a task is currently being executed, while the job is being cancelled, it doesn't get interrupted, but continue
to execute until it finishes.

To cancel a job you can use the `cancel` method on the job client.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    job = job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask(), "dev-cluster")
    # after a short while, the job gets canceled
    job_client.cancel(job)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    job = job_client.submit('my-job', MyTask(), "dev-cluster")
    # after a short while, the job gets canceled
    await job_client.cancel(job)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    A canceled job can be resumed at any time, by [retrying](#retries) it.
</Note>

If the execution of a task within a job fails, the job is automatically canceled. This is to prevent the execution
of further tasks in the job, which may not be relevant anymore, due to the failure of the task. In a future release, this
behaviour can be configured for each task individually, since there are use cases where you may want
to continue the execution of a job, even if some of its tasks fail.

## Retries

If a task within a job fails due to a bug in the task's implementation, or a lack of resources, or any other reason,
it's not necessary to resubmit the job again and re-execute all computed tasks after a fix is deployed. Instead, you can retry
the job, and the execution of the job is resumed from the point of the failure. This means that all the work that
was already done up until the point of the failure isn't lost.

<Note>
    In a future release, an automatic retry for a job for certain failure conditions can be configured.
    This can be useful in cases where an automatic retry after a certain amount of time, or after a certain
    condition makes sense.
</Note>

Below is an example of a failing job due to a bug in the task's implementation. After the initial buggy job submission, the bug
is fixed and the job is retried.

The following workflow accepts a list of movie titles, and then queries the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for the
release date of each movie.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    import httpx
    from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

    class MoviesStats(Task):
        titles: list[str]

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            for title in self.titles:
                context.submit_subtask(PrintMovieStats(title))

    class PrintMovieStats(Task):
        title: str

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            params = {"t": self.title, "apikey": "<OMDB API Key>"}
            url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/?" + urlencode(params)
            response = httpx.get(url).json()
            # set the display name of the task to the title of the movie:
            context.current_task.display = response["Title"]
            print(f"{response['Title']} was released on {response['Released']}")
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    import httpx
    from tilebox.workflows.aio import Task, ExecutionContext

    class MoviesStats(Task):
        titles: list[str]

        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            for title in self.titles:
                context.submit_subtask(PrintMovieStats(title))

    class PrintMovieStats(Task):
        title: str

        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            params = {"t": self.title, "apikey": "<OMDB API Key>"}
            url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/?" + urlencode(params)
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = (await client.get(url)).json()
                # set the display name of the task to the title of the movie:
                context.current_task.display = response["Title"]
                print(f"{response['Title']} was released on {response['Released']}")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Submitting below job reveals a bug in the `PrintMovieStats` task.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    job = job_client.submit('movies-stats', MoviesStats([
        "The Matrix",
        "Shrek 2",
        "Tilebox - The Movie",
        "The Avengers",
    ]), "dev-cluster")

    job_client.display(job)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    job = await job_client.submit('movies-stats', MoviesStats([
        "The Matrix",
        "Shrek 2",
        "Tilebox - The Movie",
        "The Avengers",
    ]), "dev-cluster")

    await job_client.display(job)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/movies-failed.svg" alt="Job that failed due to a bug in the task's implementation" className="dark:hidden"/>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/movies-failed.dark.svg" alt="Job that failed due to a bug in the task's implementation" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

It seems like one of the `PrintMovieStats` tasks failed with a `KeyError`. This probably occurs if a movie
title is not found by the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), in which case the response doesn't contain the `Title` and `Released` fields.

The console output of the task runners confirms this:

```plaintext Output
The Matrix was released on 31 Mar 1999
Shrek 2 was released on 19 May 2004
ERROR: Task PrintMovieStats failed with exception: KeyError('Title')
```

A fixed version of the `PrintMovieStats` looks like this:

<CodeGroup title="Fixed Task Implementation">
    ```python Python (Sync)
    class PrintMovieStats(Task):
        title: str

        def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            params = {"t": self.title, "apikey": "<OMDB API Key>"}
            url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/?" + urlencode(params)
            response = httpx.get(url).json()
            if "Title" in response and "Released" in response:
                context.current_task.display = response["Title"]
                print(f"{response['Title']} was released on {response['Released']}")
            else:
                context.current_task.display = f"NotFound: {self.title}"
                print(f"Could not find the release date for {self.title}")
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    class PrintMovieStats(Task):
        title: str

        async def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
            params = {"t": self.title, "apikey": "<OMDB API Key>"}
            url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/?" + urlencode(params)
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = (await client.get(url)).json()
                if "Title" in response and "Released" in response:
                    context.current_task.display = response["Title"]
                    print(f"{response['Title']} was released on {response['Released']}")
                else:
                    context.current_task.display = f"NotFound: {self.title}"
                    print(f"Could not find the release date for {self.title}")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Now with this fix in place, and the [task runners](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) redeployed with the updated
implementation of the `PrintMovieStats` task, it's time to retry the job:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python (Sync)
    job_client.retry(job)
    job_client.display(job)
    ```
    ```python Python (Async)
    await job_client.retry(job)
    await job_client.display(job)
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/movies-retried.svg" alt="Job that failed due to a bug in the task's implementation" className="dark:hidden"/>
    <img src="/assets/workflows/diagrams/svg/movies-retried.dark.svg" alt="Job that failed due to a bug in the task's implementation" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

The console output of the task now looks like this:

```plaintext Output
Could not find the release date for Tilebox - The Movie
The Avengers was released on 04 May 2012
```

<Note>
    The output of the task runner confirms that only two tasks were executed, instead of a new task for all four movies.
</Note>

Great, the job was retried and now succeeded. The two tasks that were already executed successfully
before the failure were not executed again, instead the execution was resumed from the point of the failure.
