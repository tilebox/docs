Tilebox supports user-defined progress indicators during the execution of a job. This can be useful to provide visibility into the execution and the expected duration of a job, especially for longer running jobs.

## Tracking Progress

Progress indicators in Tilebox use a `done` / `total` model. Tasks can increase a `total` value to specify the total work to be done, and the same or any other task can increase a `done` counter to track the amount of work that has already been completed.

Progress tracking is always done at a task level. Each task can report its progress updates, as increases in `done` and `total` independently, and the job's total progress is the sum of all tasks' progress.

<Info>
    Progress tracking is currently only available in the Tilebox Python SDK. Go support is coming soon.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

class MyTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        # report that 10 units of work need to be done
        context.progress().add(10)

        for _ in range(10):
            context.submit_subtask(MySubTask())

class MySubTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        # report that one unit of work has been completed
        context.progress().done(1)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Multiple Progress Indicators

A job can have multiple independent progress indicators. This is useful when a job consists of multiple steps, that each benefits from having its own progress indicator.
To create a new progress indicator, call `context.progress(name)` with a unique `name` for the indicator.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python lines focus={14-15,35,51}
from io import BytesIO

import httpx  # pip install httpx
from PIL import Image  # pip install pillow
from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext

class DownloadImages(Task):
    image_urls: list[str]

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        # download and process images from a list of URLs
        n = len(self.image_urls)

        context.progress("download").add(n)
        context.progress("process").add(n)

        for i, url in enumerate(self.image_urls):
            image_name = f"image_{i:04d}.png"
            grayscale_name = f"image_gray_{i:04d}.png"
            download = context.submit_subtask(DownloadImage(url, image_name))
            process = context.submit_subtask(
                ToGrayscale(image_name, grayscale_name),
                depends_on=[download],
            )

class DownloadImage(Task):
    url: str
    image_name: str

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        response = httpx.get(self.url, follow_redirects=True)
        context.job_cache[self.image_name] = response.read()
        
        # report that one image has been downloaded
        context.progress("download").done(1)


class ToGrayscale(Task):
    input_image: str
    output_name: str

    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(context.job_cache[self.input_image]))
        image = image.convert("L")  # convert the image to grayscale

        buffer = BytesIO()
        image.save(buffer, format="png")
        
        context.job_cache[self.output_name] = buffer.getvalue()
        
        context.progress("process").done(1)
```

## Querying Progress

At any time during a job's execution, you can query the current progress of a job using the `find` method on the job client. The returned job object contains a `progress` field that contains the current progress of the job.

<CodeGroup>
```python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

job_client = Client().jobs()
job = job_client.submit("download-images", DownloadImages(
    [
        "https://picsum.photos/id/123/500/500",
        "https://picsum.photos/id/155/500/500",
    ],
))

job = job_client.find(job.id)  # refresh the job object
print(job)
```
</CodeGroup>

```plaintext Output
Job(
    id=UUID('019952b8-a5dc-f4c0-e428-724ccc587d83'),
    name='download-images',
    ...,
    progress=[
        ProgressIndicator(label='download', total=2, done=1),
        ProgressIndicator(label='process', total=2, done=0),
    ]
)
```

## Progress idempotency

Since tasks may fail and can subsequently be retried, it's possible that a task is executed more than once. This means that a task may report progress more than once.
To avoid double-counting such progress updates, Tilebox only considers the progress reported by the last execution of a task.
