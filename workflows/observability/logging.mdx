## Overview

Since Tilebox workflows are designed to be executed in a distributed fashion, properly setting up logging to a centralized
logging system is a key aspect. Tilebox comes with built-in support for OpenTelemetry logging, which is an easy and
convenient way to log messages from your tasks, and export them to a backend of your choice. Collecting and visualizing
logs from a distributed cluster of task runners and visualizing them in a tool such as [Axiom](https://axiom.co/) might look like the following:

## Configure Logging

The Tilebox workflow SDKs contain built-in support for exporting open telemetry logs. To enable logging, simply
call the corresponding configuration functions during the start up of your [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners)
and then use to Tilebox provided `logger` to emit log messages from your tasks.

    <Tab title="Axiom">
    To configure logging with Axiom, you first need to create a [Axiom Dataset](https://axiom.co/docs/reference/datasets)
    to export Tilebox workflow logs to. Additionally, an API key with ingest permissions to that dataset is required.
    
    ```python Python
    from tilebox.workflows import Client, Task, ExecutionContext
    from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import configure_otel_logging_axiom

    # your own workflow:
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    def main():
        configure_otel_logging_axiom(
            # specify an axiom dataset to export logs to
            dataset="my-axiom-logs-dataset",
            # along with an axiom api key with ingest permissions to that dataset
            api_key="my-axiom-api-key",
        )

        # below task runner will export logs from 
        # the tasks it executes to the specified axiom dataset
        client = Client()
        runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
        runner.run_forever()
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    <Tip>
        If you set environment variables `AXIOM_API_KEY` and `AXIOM_LOGS_DATASET` you can omit those arguments
        to the `configure_otel_logging_axiom` function.
    </Tip>
    
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="OpenTelemetry-compatible backend">
    If you are using a OpenTelemetry-compatible backend other than Axiom, such as OpenTelemetry Collector or Jaeger,
    you can still easily configure logging by manually specifying the endpoint to export logs to.

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.workflows import Client
    from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import configure_otel_logging

    # your own workflow:
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    def main():
        configure_otel_logging(
            # specify an endpoint to export logs to, in this case a
            # locally running instance of opentelemetry collector
            endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/logs",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer some-api-key"},  # optional headers to send with each request
        )

        # below task runner will export logs from 
        # the tasks it executes to the specified endpoint
        client = Client()
        runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
        runner.run_forever()
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    <Tip>
        If you set environment variable `OTEL_LOGS_ENDPOINT` you can omit that argument
        to the `configure_otel_logging` function.
    </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Console">
        If you want to log messages to the standard output of the console, you can use the `configure_console_logging` 
        function.

        ```python Python
        from tilebox.workflows import Client
        from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import configure_console_logging

        # your own workflow:
        from my_workflow import MyTask

        def main():
            configure_console_logging()

            # below task runner will print log messages from
            # the tasks it executes to the console
            client = Client()
            runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
            runner.run_forever()
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        <Warning>
            The console logging backend is not recommended for production use, since log messages are emitted to the
            standard output of each task runner, and not to a centralized logging system. It is intended for local
            development and testing of workflows.
        </Warning>
    </Tab>

## Emitting log messages

The Tilebox SDKs provide a `logger` that can be used to emit log messages from your tasks. Use it within
a tasks `execute` method to emit log messages to the [configured logging backend](#configure-logging).

```python Python
import logging
from tilebox.workflows import Task, ExecutionContext
from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import get_logger

class MyTask(Task):
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> None:
        # emit a log message to the configured open telemetry backend
        logger.info("Hello world from configured logger!")
```

<Tip>
    The `logger` is a global singleton, so you can use it anywhere in your workflow. If you want to use a different
    logger for a specific task, you can create a new logger using the `get_logger` function.
</Tip>

## Logging task runner internals

Tilebox Task runners also use such a logger internally. By default it's configured to the WARNING level, but you
can change this by explicitly configuring a logger for the workflows client constructing the task runner.

```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client

from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import configure_otel_logging_axiom
from tilebox.workflows.observability.logging import get_logger

# configure axiom or any other logging backend
configure_otel_logging_axiom(
    dataset="my-axiom-logs-dataset",
    api_key="my-axiom-api-key",
)

# configure a logger for the Tilebox client, with a level of INFO
client = Client()
client.configure_logger(get_logger(level=logging.INFO))

# now the task runner will inherit this logger and use
# it to emit its own, internal log messages as well
runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
runner.run_forever()
```
