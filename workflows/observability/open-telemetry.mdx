## Observability

Since Tilebox Workflows is designed to be a general-purpose workflow orchestrator, and supports distributed execution out
of the box, sophisticated observability is a key feature. To build reliable and efficient workflows, it's
important to be able to understand and observe the execution of workflows and their tasks. This section covers
techniques to gain insights into the execution of your workflows.

## Open Telemetry

Tilebox Workflows is built with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in mind. OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs and libraries that are used to
instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for distributed systems.

<Info>
Currently, Tilebox Workflows supports OpenTelemetry for tracing and logging, with support for metrics planned for the
future.

## Integrations

Tilebox implements exporting of telemetry data using the [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).

<img src="/assets/workflows/observability/tilebox-axiom.png" alt="Tilebox comes pre-integrated with Axiom" />

One service that supports this protocol is [Axiom](https://axiom.co/), a cloud-based observability and telemetry platform.
Tilebox Workflows comes with built-in support for Axiom, and the examples and screenshots in this section come from this integration.

But additionally any other OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, such as OpenTelemetry Collector or
Jaeger can also be used to collect telemetry data produced by Tilebox Workflows.
