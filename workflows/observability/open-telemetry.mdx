## Observability

Effective observability is essential for building reliable workflows. Understanding and monitoring the execution of workflows and their tasks helps ensure correctness and efficiency. This section describes methods to gain insights into your workflow's execution.

## OpenTelemetry

Tilebox Workflows is designed with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in mind, which provides a set of APIs and libraries for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) in distributed systems.

<Info>
Tilebox Workflows currently supports OpenTelemetry for tracing and logging, with plans to include metrics in the future.

## Integrations

Tilebox exports telemetry data using the [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).

<img src="/assets/workflows/observability/tilebox-axiom.png" alt="Tilebox is pre-integrated with Axiom" />

Axiom, a cloud-based observability and telemetry platform, supports this protocol. Tilebox Workflows has built-in support for Axiom, and the examples and screenshots in this section come from this integration.

Additionally, any other OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, such as OpenTelemetry Collector or Jaeger, can be used to collect telemetry data generated by Tilebox Workflows.
