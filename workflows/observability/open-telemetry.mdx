## Observability

Effective observability is essential for building reliable workflows. Understanding and monitoring the execution of workflows and their tasks helps ensure correctness and efficiency. This section describes methods to gain insights into your workflow's execution.

## OpenTelemetry

Tilebox Workflows is designed with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in mind, which provides a set of APIs and libraries for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) in distributed systems.

<Info>
Tilebox Workflows currently supports OpenTelemetry for tracing and logging, with plans to include metrics in the future.

## Integrations

Tilebox exports telemetry data using the [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/). This allows you to send telemetry data to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, such as Axiom or Jaeger.

### Axiom

<img src="/assets/workflows/observability/tilebox-axiom.png" alt="Tilebox is pre-integrated with Axiom" />

Tilebox Workflows has built-in support for Axiom, a cloud-based observability and telemetry platform. The examples and screenshots in this section come from this integration.

To get started, [sign up for a free Axiom account](https://axiom.co/), create an axiom dataset for traces and logs, and generate an API key with ingest permissions for those datasets.

You can then configure Tilebox to export traces and logs to Axiom using [configure_otel_tracing_axiom](/workflows/observability/tracing#axiom) and [configure_otel_logging_axiom](/workflows/observability/logging#axiom).

### Jaeger

<img src="/assets/workflows/observability/tilebox-jaeger.png" alt="Tilebox works well with Jaeger" />

Another popular option is [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io/), a popular distributed tracing system. You can use the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to collect telemetry data from Tilebox Workflows and export it to Jaeger.

An all-in-one Jaeger environment can be spun up using Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
    -p 5778:5778 \
    -p 16686:16686 \
    -p 4318:4318 \
    jaegertracing/jaeger:2.9.0
```

You can then configure Tilebox to export traces to Jaeger using `configure_otel_tracing`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from tilebox.workflows import Client
from tilebox.workflows.observability.tracing import configure_otel_tracing

# your own workflow:
from my_workflow import MyTask

def main():
    configure_otel_tracing(
        # export traces to the local Jaeger instance
        endpoint="http://localhost:4318",
    )

    # the following task runner generates traces for executed tasks and
    # exports trace and span data to the specified endpoint
    client = Client()
    runner = client.runner(tasks=[MyTask])
    runner.run_forever()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
```go Go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log/slog"

	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/examples/workflows/opentelemetry"
	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/observability"
	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/observability/tracer"
	"github.com/tilebox/tilebox-go/workflows/v1"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
)

// specify a service name and version to identify the instrumenting application in traces and logs
var service = &observability.Service{Name: "task-runner", Version: "dev"}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	endpoint := "http://localhost:4318"

	// Setup an OpenTelemetry trace span processor, exporting traces and spans to an OTEL compatible trace endpoint
	tileboxTracerProvider, shutdown, err := tracer.NewOtelProvider(ctx, service, tracer.WithEndpointURL(endpoint))
	defer shutdown(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		slog.Error("failed to set up otel span processor", slog.Any("error", err))
		return
	}
	otel.SetTracerProvider(tileboxTracerProvider) // set the tilebox tracer provider as the global OTEL tracer provider

	client := workflows.NewClient()

	taskRunner, err := client.NewTaskRunner(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		slog.Error("failed to create task runner", slog.Any("error", err))
		return
	}

	err = taskRunner.RegisterTasks(&MyTask{})
	if err != nil {
		slog.Error("failed to register tasks", slog.Any("error", err))
		return
	}

	taskRunner.RunForever(ctx)
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The generated workflow traces can then be viewed in the Jaeger UI at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).
