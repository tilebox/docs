## Overview

Applying [Opentelemetry Traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) to the concept of workflows
means observing the execution of the workflow and the individual tasks within it. Visualizing the traces produced by a
workflow in a tool such as [Axiom](https://axiom.co/) might look like the following:

</Frame>

By tracing your workflows you can easily observe:

- the order in which tasks are executed
- which tasks are executed in parallel
- which [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners) is executing each task
- the duration of each task
- the outcome of each task (success, failure)

This can be useful to identify bottlenecks and performance issues, and to ensure that your workflows are
executing as expected.

## Configure tracing

The Tilebox workflow SDKs contain built-in support for exporting open telemetry traces. To enable tracing, simply
call the corresponding configuration functions during the start up of your [task runner](/workflows/concepts/task-runners).

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Axiom">
    To configure tracing with Axiom, you first need to create a [Axiom Dataset](https://axiom.co/docs/reference/datasets)
    to export Tilebox workflow traces to. Additionally, an API key with ingest permissions to that dataset is required.
    
    ```python Python
    from tilebox.workflows import Client
    from tilebox.workflows.observability.tracing import configure_otel_tracing_axiom

    # your own workflow:
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    def main():
        configure_otel_tracing_axiom(
            # specify an axiom dataset to export traces to
            dataset="my-axiom-traces-dataset",
            # along with an axiom api key with ingest permissions to that dataset
            api_key="my-axiom-api-key",
        )

        # below task runner will generate traces for the tasks it executes and
        # export trace and span data to the specified axiom dataset
        client = Client()
        runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
        runner.run_forever()
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    <Tip>
        If you set environment variables `AXIOM_API_KEY` and `AXIOM_TRACES_DATASET` you can omit those arguments
        to the `configure_otel_tracing_axiom` function.
    </Tip>
    
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="OpenTelemetry-compatible backend">
    If you are using a OpenTelemetry-compatible backend other than Axiom, such as OpenTelemetry Collector or Jaeger,
    you can still easily configure tracing by manually specifying the endpoint to ingest traces to.

    ```python Python
    from tilebox.workflows import Client
    from tilebox.workflows.observability.tracing import configure_otel_tracing

    # your own workflow:
    from my_workflow import MyTask

    def main():
        configure_otel_tracing(
            # specify an endpoint to ingest traces to, in this case a
            # locally running instance of opentelemetry collector
            endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer some-api-key"},  # optional headers to send with each request
        )

        # below task runner will generate traces for the tasks it executes and
        # export trace and span data to the specified endpoint
        client = Client()
        runner = client.runner("dev-cluster", tasks=[MyTask])
        runner.run_forever()
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    <Tip>
        If you set environment variable `OTEL_TRACES_ENDPOINT` you can omit that argument
        to the `configure_otel_tracing` function.
    </Tip>
    </Tab>

As soon as the runner picks up tasks and executes them, corresponding traces and spans are automatically generated
and exported to the configured backend.
