Tilebox is a software development kit for accessing, processing and distributing remote sensing satellite data, from raw data to insight. It bridges the gap between the types of software scientists, data scientists and engineers write, and backend systems that software engineers write.

## Modules

Tilebox currently consists of two main modules:
