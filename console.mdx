The [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com) is a web-based interface that allows you to explore your datasets and workflows.
It's structured into tabs which correspond to the different modules of Tilebox.

## Datasets Tab

The datasets tab allows you to explore the datasets that are available for your organization. You can select a dataset,
view its collections and load data for a collection in a given time range.

If you click a specific event time within the data point list view, you'll see a detailed view of that data point.

### Export as Code

Once you have selected a dataset, collection, and time range, you can export the current selection as a python code snippet.
This pastes a code snippet like the one below into your clipboard.

```python
from tilebox.datasets import Client

client = Client()
datasets = client.datasets()
sentinel2_msi = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel2_msi
data = sentinel2_msi.collection("S2A_S2MSI1C").load(
    ("2024-07-12", "2024-07-26"),
    show_progress=True,
)
```

<Tip>
  Paste the snippet into a [notebook](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks) to interactively explore the
  [`xarray.Dataset`](/sdks/python/xarray) that is returned.

## Workflows Tab

The workflows tab is currently being developed. Stay tuned for updates.

## Account Tab

The account tab allows you to manage your API keys. You can create new API keys, revoke existing ones, and view the currently active API keys.
