## Start in a Notebook

Explore the provided [Sample Notebooks](/sdks/python/sample-notebooks) to begin your journey with Tilebox. These notebooks offer a step-by-step guide to using the API and showcase many features supported by Tilebox Python clients. You can also use these notebooks as a foundation for your own projects.

## Start on Your Device

If you prefer to work locally, follow these steps to get started.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Install Packages">
      Install the Tilebox Python packages. The easiest way to do this is using `pip`:

      ```
      pip install tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows tilebox-storage
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create an API Key">
      Create an API key by logging into the [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com), navigating to [Account -> API Keys](https://console.tilebox.com/account/api-keys), and clicking the "Create API Key" button.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Query Data">
      Use the datasets client to query data from a dataset.

      ```python Python
      from tilebox.datasets import Client

      client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")

      # select a dataset
      datasets = client.datasets()
      dataset = datasets.open_data.copernicus.sentinel2_msi

      # and load data from a collection in a given time range
      collection = dataset.collection("S2A_S2MSI1C")
      data_january_2022 = collection.load(("2022-01-01", "2022-02-01"))
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run a Workflow">
      Use the workflows client to create a task and submit it as a job.

      ```python Python
      from tilebox.workflows import Client, Task

      class MyFirstTask(Task):
        def execute(self):
          print("Hello World from my first Tilebox task!")

      client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")

      # submit a job
      jobs = client.jobs()
      jobs.submit("my-very-first-job", MyFirstTask(), "some-compute-cluster")

      # and run it
      runner = client.runner("some-compute-cluster", tasks=[MyFirstTask])
      runner.run_all()
      ```

      <Note>
        To use this snippet, you need to have a cluster already created. Check out the guide on [clusters](/workflows/concepts/clusters) to learn how to create one.
