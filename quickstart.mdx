## Start in a Notebook

Check out the provided [Sample Notebooks](sdks/python/sample-notebooks) that you can use to get started with the Tilebox API.
They provide a step-by-step guide to using the API and cover a wide variety of the features supported by Tilebox Python clients.
You can also use the notebooks as a starting point for your own projects.

## Start on your device

If you prefer to work locally in your device, the steps below help you get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install packages">
    Install the Tilebox python packages. The easiest way to do this is using `pip`.
    ```
    pip install tilebox-datasets tilebox-workflows
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    Create an API key by logging into the [Tilebox Console](https://console.tilebox.com), heading to [Settings -> API Keys](https://console.tilebox.com/settings/api-keys) and clicking on the "Create API Key" button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Query data">
    Use the datasets client to query data from a dataset.

    ```python
    from tilebox.datasets import Client

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")
    
    # select an open data dataset
    datasets = client.datasets()
    dataset = datasets.open_data.asf.sentinel2_msi

    # and load data from a collection in a given time range
    collection = dataset.collection("S2A_S2MSI1C")
    data_january_2022 = collection.load(("2022-01-01", "2022-02-01"))
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a workflow task">
    Use the workflows client to create and submit a task.

    ```python
    from tilebox.workflows import Client, Task

    class MyFirstTask(Task):
      def execute(self):
        print("Hello World from my first Tilebox task!")

    client = Client(token="YOUR_TILEBOX_API_KEY")

    # submit a job
    jobs = client.jobs()
    jobs.submit("my-very-first-job", MyFirstTask(), "some-compute-cluster")

    # and run it
    runner = client.runner("some-compute-cluster", tasks=[MyFirstTask])
    runner.run_all()
    ```

    <Note>
      For this snippet to work you need to have a cluster already created. Check out the guide on [clusters](/workflows/clusters) to learn how to create one.
